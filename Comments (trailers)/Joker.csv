-_DJEzZk2pc,Watch the BRAND NEW trailer for Joker released today! ----> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2enBkAcnMj4
-_DJEzZk2pc,The Jokers makeup looks like shit.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Stupid
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker and batman are two sides of the same coin called gotham.
-_DJEzZk2pc,So... What's the plot?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I want a batman cinematic universe with this movie. Forget about the DC universe. I want a batverse
-_DJEzZk2pc,"that was scary....a guy turns into a clown gets a sign smashed over his head gets beat up and always running away and is standing in an elevator.....

Looks horrifying...
 ""In other words"" it doesn't look worth watching

And there is too much communism popping out of Hollywood.
Why fund them... if they had it their way, you couldn't afford the movie"
-_DJEzZk2pc,So close to 1 mil subs
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can someone say he‚Äôs back!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin better get his Oscar (finally)  those bastards snubbed him as Commodus in Gladiator damn was I pissed....
-_DJEzZk2pc,This has got so many negative votes because every member of Antifa has just recognised themselves.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I would be scared to see this in the movies bc in case someone would bring a gun and shoot up the threater how sad is that but it looks good
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Creepiest trailer ever.  Plus ,ales me think of Heath Ledger and how he got so far into the role that it killed him."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I love his voice
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker fans like here
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I just don't like Batman
But i love Joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The problem with the Dark Knight is that the Joker doesn't win,  the boats don't blow up and Harvey doesn't kill the commissioner's family.  Great character portrayal though it was, it was just a bit too tame a plot for the awesome psycho that Ledger was portraying.. I think the casting for this is inspired, he is the one I would always have cast before the Dark Knight for the role which is made for his darkness."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Rip Joker.. the first one was way better.... this actor is a joke
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So this is nothing but a boring drama. Great! 
You ruined the joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Bestmovieforeveeeeeerrrr
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Sympathy for the devil?  


Not the JOkeR I remember . . ."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Isn't the real name of the Joker supposed to be unknown?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Woowww what a performance.
I'll say his a great and great actor."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath ledger is real legendüíïüíïüíï
-_DJEzZk2pc,"To this story Is about a man who strived to be positive, and the world kept on shitting  on him and then he turned the joke on them, and its an actual reality when you can push someone too far and their other side reveals itself, and ppl act like your the crazy one but the truth is they contributed to this man's drastic change and don't admit fault on any of it except point fingers at him for becoming the person he has become The Joker üÉè, this is a sad but true reality it can happen to anyone, people can be so cruel at times, just look at all the school shooters and similar acts  when you study it you can see there's reasons why these kids snapped, bullying etc etc, sad and harsh reality."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why this movie wasn't upload in online
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It was hard in 2006, I love Joaquin and I think he deserved the Oscar but come on... he lost for Philip Seymour Hoffman! We can all agree worst things have happened in that ceremony üôÑ This time it‚Äôs his... there‚Äôs no way they can ignore it!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,where jared leto
-_DJEzZk2pc,If that's not an Oscar i don't know what is
-_DJEzZk2pc,This shits trash
-_DJEzZk2pc,wow! he could win best actor here... DC made a decent movie this time......must watch film of DC
-_DJEzZk2pc,the king of comedy with a twist of taxi driver plus the Joker....
-_DJEzZk2pc,ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°
-_DJEzZk2pc,Who else from India after watching this incredible movie‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why do I feel sad watching this trailer :(
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joker means ""Odd face card in the deck"" , but here in imaginative world this is the way to get the goddamm 'OSCAR' to Mr. Phillips and Mr. Phoenix ‚úì ü§°"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath ledger major missing
-_DJEzZk2pc,"i'm obsessed with the sound in this trailer and in general this trailer.
this is how u make good movie trailers."
-_DJEzZk2pc,The ppl who own YouTube need to teach the ppl who own IG how to clean up the comment sections. The mentally ill retards have made their way over to IG.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is the movie I‚Äôve been waiting for my whole fucking life, literally cannot wait to watch it"
-_DJEzZk2pc,CAN'T WAIT
-_DJEzZk2pc,I never thought anyone would iut do Jack's performance but Heath did it so Joachim might do it I can't wait to see it
-_DJEzZk2pc,The reason Joaquin Phoenix will out perform the others is because he will be playing the Joker for the entire movie. Jack Nicholson & Heath Ledger were fucking phenomenal and brilliant but I can't wait to see what Joaquin brings to the table. He's an amazing actor so I have no doubt. He made his face is scary as fuck without the makeup in the trailer so he was born for this role.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'll not see this simply because of Robert De Niro.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This channel made the good video of painting Joker..
https://youtu.be/dERbv2oiEEI"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""The worst part about having a mental illness is, people, expect you to behave as if you don't""_jOKER"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This has nothing to do with a Suicide Squad Joker. Who thinks Jared Leto makes a better Joker? I miss the sexy and intense puddin
-_DJEzZk2pc,What a great actor!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Jokar ander se itna dukhi Kyu hai chahe raaj Kapoor ki Mera naam joker ho ya koi bhi joker wo ander se dard me  Kyu hai
-_DJEzZk2pc,seems no jokes in the film Joker...I mean seriously :-[
-_DJEzZk2pc,Man I can‚Äôt wait I would go to the theater to see this which I don‚Äôt usually do
-_DJEzZk2pc,Was anybody surprised by how good this looked?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"See this before seeing the Joker.   Our exclusive in depth pre-review.  Only here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spSCAvNuT50&t=22s"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I got an add of joker movie wtff
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Dc has this ONE AND ONLY weapon, the joker, to defeat the marvel comics"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nice
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yo this movie looks fucking terrible.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Who miss Heath Ledger ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,When keeping it real may be too much! .... This movie has a potential darkness factor that may have negative manifestations in this dimension...  The R rating is your red flag... I totally get DC going balls out in the fight for money at the box office because Marvel is crushing it. But at the expense of subconscious exposure to madness... Not cool.. Why add to the insanity? And if you think ... It's just a dumb old movie... Your asleep... Wake up
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel like this movie is going to be awesome
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nope
-_DJEzZk2pc,I do not want to see a single chad or Veronica in the audience
-_DJEzZk2pc,"He might be the best joker as of yet? 
The dark knight joker was bad ass though"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Best movies of the year: joker trailer.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don't understand why they remake Joker after Heath Ledger story... but i'll watch this anyway!
-_DJEzZk2pc,17 million view! Insane!
-_DJEzZk2pc,It looks so good
-_DJEzZk2pc,could DC have actually made a watchable movie at last ?   trailer shows nothing lol
-_DJEzZk2pc,No one can't be better than Heath ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,damn this looks even darker than heath ledger‚Äôs joker. really want to see this. definitely an upgrade from jared leto‚Äôs awful performance.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Personally my favourite movie is shazam.!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,It is getting crazier. In my community crime has increased. It was never like that before. üòü
-_DJEzZk2pc,"A new low for Hollywood, who has defined sodomizing society's values. An incredible feat actually."
-_DJEzZk2pc,It so fuckin awesome
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I‚Äôve only watched the first trailer and the second. Nothing more. I‚Äôve been avoiding spoilers left and right cos this, this movie will be a once in a lifetime experience"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"MARVEL: We have the Avengers
DC: Hahahaha! Bring out the Joker!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think its not scary like last time. Im so scared cuz hes a killer? I dont know
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like DC is steppin up it's game!!! Go Joaquin Pheonix!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This film is gonna be soooo bad ass!! can't wait to see it!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"society does not care about boys young or old, women make boys emotionally dependent and when they don't get what they want, they tell the boys to get lost, same old story, ""its not about the money, its about sending a message""-heath ledger"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Doing the role of joker after Heath ledger nailed it , It needs guts"
-_DJEzZk2pc,https://youtu.be/4itBVNKKIOY
-_DJEzZk2pc,I would of rather seen a joker movie with the guy who saved Harley Quinn at the end of the last movie he seems more sicotic .and does better
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Mark my words!
BATMAN will show at the end of the movie!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,vivimos en una sociedad jaja que loco
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The Joker, a physical representation of the internal angst living within the collective conscience of the disenfranchised. The Batman, an elitist fighting against the result of extreme wealth. He (The Batman) doesn't fight for justice, his fight is to maintain injustice, obviously he's oblivious to that fact because he doesn't want to see the collapse of the system which creates deplorable conditions which breed madness. The world is inverted, we've been conditioned to see The Batman as a hero when in truth he is the ultimate villain. The Joker, we're told he's a madman, he's called a murderer... but on the quest for wealth & prestige how many wars have the elite started? How many countless souls lost their lives fighting the elites war(s) for capital? The Joker has killed far less. The Joker is a collective rage fighting against the establishment. Their war (Batman & Joker) never ends because this is an age old story we're still repeating, even today."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Everyone, don't watch this satanic movie. Jesus is King and He is returning soon and only He can save you from hell. Read the book of revelation in the Bible to see how He is going to return."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Last time I was excited about any clown was when IT came out. Now I can barely wait to see the Joker. I'm most excited about the back story & build up. DC will do the Joker Justiceüî•
-_DJEzZk2pc,"*My Mother always tells me : 

PUT ON A HAPPY FACE*"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"1:22 

But... No one in their right mind would even stay on the same train as him, so tf?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,If we're backing the Joker (and in this case I am) what does that say about how far we've fallen as a society.....
-_DJEzZk2pc,Who‚Äôs gonna see it Thursday
-_DJEzZk2pc,I just realized how many times I‚Äôve watched this trailer ü§™ can‚Äôt wait for Friday
-_DJEzZk2pc,Geezzz! Joaquin Is perfect for this. Never pictured him playing the Joker role before. This is genius. I hope the movie lives up to the trailers. I am guessing this movie will be filled with so much emotion. Putting a light of how complex the human mind can really become when it‚Äôs inflicted with so much injustice. Darkness creates darkness.
-_DJEzZk2pc,#king üòé
-_DJEzZk2pc,It actually looks good
-_DJEzZk2pc,https://youtu.be/4tBYqawXW7M
-_DJEzZk2pc,Watching this 3-4 times a day who‚Äôs with me?!?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I bet a dollar that by the end of this film, it shows Joker in an interview room in Arkham Asylum telling Dr. Harleen Quinzel that that's how it all happened, while she remained skeptical about the story because of some contradictory records."
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's gamer time
-_DJEzZk2pc,These McDonalds commercials are getting out of hand
-_DJEzZk2pc,Im guessing im in 10% of people who think that this movie will be bad
-_DJEzZk2pc,When i was a kid I hate joker so much but after know he back story damn I love him so much
-_DJEzZk2pc,There's always something dark about DC  comics.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The moment you realise, at the beginning of the movie that he walks up the stairs, it actually stands for the fact he's trying to get his live back on track, but due to society spitting him out like garbage, he's walking down the stairs towards total insanity really shows in what kind of society we live, respect from the Netherlands"
-_DJEzZk2pc,The question you have to ask yourself about Joaquin Phoenix is. Could he play the Joker along side Batman?; I feel like Batman would kick the hell out of Joaquin Phoenix.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It's like Taxi Driver and The Dark Knight had a beautiful, beautiful baby. I mean, DeNiro is in both, and Joker does get hit by a taxi in the trailer. So... who knows?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,No one can replace heath Ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,Every fedora wearing pedo gonna be there
-_DJEzZk2pc,I noticed the thugs who abused the joker in this trailer are all white. what American city is this?
-_DJEzZk2pc,CLOWN WORLD. WE ARE ALL CLOWNS.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Omg he is so skinny now
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nope ! Heath still #1 to me
-_DJEzZk2pc,I been waiting forever for a joker movie I‚Äôm definitely doing a review on my channel when it release
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Good movie based on true life story , from good man to an bad man because of.people!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is thoroughly terrifying. In all the other movies we have seen with the Joker, he has been an inhuman figure. A great, frightening being that we have never seen as a truly human person. But now that we get to see him as he TRULY is-a broken man with an even more broken psyche-he is immeasurably more scary. He is a human, a relatable human who is suffering and breaks under the pressure and darkness of his life. This is madness slowly blooming in a person, and we get to watch as this man becomes the horrifying creature we know and love to hate today. This is how Joker should have and always will be. We saw only a small, slight look at this in the Dark Knight, but now we get the full story. I am more excited than ever to see a movie with this character and what it entails."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nice movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,If someone is interested the song‚Äôs name is Smile by Charlie Chaplin
-_DJEzZk2pc,it looks like shit i bet it will be overrated
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Heath Ledger, you have been bested."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not trying to down play Joaquin Phoenix but his bro was a way better actor and thats just scary because dude can act.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why they remaking walk the line tho ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Johnny Cash is the joker wow my life is complete
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope the crazies stay at home and ruin a good movie for those of us normal people who like being entertained. Stay the fuck away sickos!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This act is so fucking skillful.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Just simply amazing. Wow!
-_DJEzZk2pc,He showed the cruel what they showed him
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hate that they turned the joker into a pussy
-_DJEzZk2pc,This joker seems very boooring
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Can't believe Joaquin is gong to ruin his career being cast with Robert Dumb Niro.... He's poison now.  Can't get over the fact his girl HildaBEAST lost, even after all the lying, cheating, stealing and bribing.  Dumb Niro has TDS.. Trump Derangement Syndrome.  Hope his soon to be ex wife hose$ him big time.  Sorry Joaquin, you made a big mistake."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Hmmf...............well its way more of a drama and background on Joker than it is anything Batman related and or superhero or supervillain related. This is way more of a ""psychological drama"" than anything else, by the way I do not understand how ? Or why ? The FBI & Military have issued warnings about this films release ? I mean all I understand is that apparently this film might motivate some kind of person or people to shoot up a movie theater ?.........how fucking stupid and mindless do you have to be ? How dumb ? How ridiculously delusional must a person be to BECOME RILED UP BY A MOVIE ?.........you have to have an extremely weak mind & an extremely delusional ego and be delusional to have to carry out harm onto innocent people just for a movie ? I hope no one is harmed by anyone and  its my opinion no one should blame Hollywood or this film or Joaquin Phoenix........I mean did Phoenix or Hollywood carry out a mass shooting ? Does a gun shoot on its own ? .....NO. Blame the individual weak, delusional and stupid of mind who may carry out an act of cowardice blame that person. I meam look at the kind of world we live in these days.........a movie.....A....fuck - ing - mo - vie will likely incite violence ? How ridiculously stupid is that. My opinion on people as a whole is solidified, affirmed, confirmed and absolute in that MOST PEOPLE ARE GOD DAM FUCKING STUPID."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""I used to think my life is a tragedy, but now I realize...it's a comedy"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,Maybe it's just me... But it seems kinda corny
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie is about evil and your consumption of it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now that Roger Federer retired from Tennis...awesome
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like sh*t
-_DJEzZk2pc,"What's the big idea? This movie is being declared a threat to ?somebody's mental stability. Why hasn't the same been done about the multiple violent, disgusting video games that children are allowed to play for hours every day? Yet some people wonder why there are so many mass shootings and other actions of obviously mentally unstable young persons in our society. Wake up people!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,More Satanic crap from the Hollywood minions who are just following their Master's orders.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Poor joker

-_DJEzZk2pc,Fukin hell..I'm watching this for the 50th time but still get chillsüòçüòçüòç
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This movie is just an allegory for mass alienation and future collapse. It's dark, maybe brooding, but definitely depressing, ugly, gross, phantasmagorical. Unlike the Batman films, it's horror, not action. And it's horror not because it has traditional horrifying elements, like monsters and gore and such, but because you can see that this is America. This is not fantasy and escape with popcorn, this is what millions are feeling like to some degree. I can't imagine the film could end well, as America is not going to end well. I have no plans on seeing it as I get enough chaos and ugliness on a daily basis."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks like it will be a very crappy movie. .No thanks I'll pass
-_DJEzZk2pc,"People are fucking dumb for thinking this will inspire terrorism. Living in the world we live in is enough to inspire mass shootings. Fucking grow up. Get some real shit to bitch and moan about, like kids doing drag."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fuk so good about this movie?  Am I the only one who is not interested?

-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm glad there finally giving this guy a REAL backstory... hes been such an interesting villain for so long and this will make it that much better!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Did Hollywood forget a joker is a jokester, you know, someone that is joking around all the time.

A joker is funny, like Jim Carey.

Jim Carey should have been the joker.

This new joker is just a boring clown, with clown makeup and none of the clown sense of humor.

That's why the Joker from Suicide Squad was complete trash! 

He's not funny, he's just a juggalo pimp. 

And this new joker is not funny, he's just an old Man.

-_DJEzZk2pc,The person who made this trailer should make trailers for every movie to come. Thank you.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie looks like trash. His laugh sounds nothing like a real laugh it sounds forced. And the outfit this version  of Joker is in is a down right joke with the worst punchline  of all time. Ya this one will be a rent or one I watch for free . F%^k this trash movie. And also where is the Cheif of Police at the Time Jim Gordon who later becomes commissioner Gordon? Ya this movie is going to be hot garbage.  Possibly  even worse then the dumpster  fire that was the idiotic Aquaman  movie. That movie was confusing AF but at least they had the proper source material  in it from the comics. But still even that couldn't save that movie it was complete shit also. And now 2019 Joker film looks like another laughing turd!!

-_DJEzZk2pc,Phoenix's Joker would be damn absolutely fantastic and speak to the masses if he had both an abusive father and abusive mother like myself. I genuinely absolutely wish that that man and his daughters are dead. Sorry drunken speech.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The Joker is my favorite villian. I saw the short trailer & thought I don't know how I feel about this. Saw who was playing the Joker and thought I don't know why but I just don't see him as the Joker. Now I've watched this longer trailer and thought...no. I'm sorry but I feel like not knowing anything about the Jokers past is part of what makes him the villian he is. The movie is trying to give some sort of humanity to him or give a reason to feel sorry for him, no. The Joker is the bringer of chaos, doesn't matter which version you watch. I personally prefer the psychotic bronze age joker, which Heath Ledger portrayed, followed very closely by the golden age, which Jack Nicholson portrayed. All that to say, stop trying to give criminals sympathy points. Oh this mass murder was bullied so that gives him an excuse for his actions. You know what an excuse is? A skin of a reason stuffed with a lie. Let the great comic book villian just be a comic book villian. He doesn't need a back story, he doesn't need a reason, a lot a people love the fact that no one know. The mystery is part of the character. STOP TRYING TO RUIN THE CHARACTER!!!"

-_DJEzZk2pc,"So it's Arthur now? How many names does The Joker need? What was wrong with Jack or Jeremiah?

20 years ago, this could have been a sketch on MAD TV or Saturday Night Live. Do we really need drama origin stories for action comic book characters?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,So thats origin of dark knight version of joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Maybe the first ""superhero"" film I can actually watch.  You know - for grown-ups ??   The trailer alone shows  a reflection of our depression-meds-popping society that has NO spiritual guidance what-so-ever (and I DON'T mean religion)  or any sense of purpose; where real connections have been replaced by electronic connectivity.  So, in the real world, everyone is  now seen as a threat unless  they're tucked away safely in a Facebook post.   Thus, the ""comedy"" begins and you might as well wear a phony mask - since that's the only face people will see.   ""Gee.......why did that guy kill himself??..........he just posted a smiling selfie on Instagram  yesterday""  DUH !!!!!    Joaquin  gets it for sure."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie will revive DC !
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:50 is that young batman?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Reminds me of hellblade
-_DJEzZk2pc,My only problem with this movie is that they make the Joker be a mere victim of society instead of a feared  maniacal criminal mastermind capable of bringing an entire city into anarchy. Batman would have no problem taking down this fragile man.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Years ago (maybe 14 or so) when our daughter was about 3 or 4 she yelled at the tv ""run Joker, Batman is coming!"" it was a cartoon series and I had no idea what she saw in him to make her root for the bad guy and sadly now I do. Wow!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Who needs the movie, this trailer is awesome !!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Better then avengers.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ok so it looks like it may be entertaining at best and everyone here is creaming themselves over it. I hope it's good, but man is it hard to get behind the origin of a 50something year old Joker.

Just my humble opinion, no need to crucify me."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I pray that I lose my mind just like this guy!!!!!ü§£
-_DJEzZk2pc,I smell Oscars

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Seems to be a very fine movie. I love to see the human behind the monster. And to understand, that a monster is not necessarily evil from the start. Maybe that calms the Monster in me. But one question remains - is a Monster the Monster or the people who created this Monster? Take the nicest Dog alive. Hit him often and hard enough and don‚Äôt stop doing this. What will happen? The dog will break inside or one day he will fight back and will not stop fighting. We will have mercy with the brocken dog but we will hate and fear the fighting dog. But is really the dog to blame? Fighting to make sure, this will never happen again to him? No. I am very interested to talk to god about this, when I am gone. I think sin is not, what we think it is. Consider -  Jesus never sent away a sinner. Never. As long as he or she wasn‚Äôt self righteous. As I said - very interested."

-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is going to be epic. He makes Batman look like a ridiculous idiot with his cape and bat ears that are usually worn by low class white black and Hispanics girls on Halloween or as a filter on their Facebook profile. Even Batman would be disturbed by this guy. The Dark Knight doesn‚Äôt come close to this because it actually offers a backstory and true character study into what created someone to end up being this. Putting Joaquin Phoenix in it gives it street cred. Ironically it probably won‚Äôt get nominated for anything as Hollywood doesn‚Äôt take movies seriously no matter how great they are if it involves comic book anything. This is too badass for the Oscars, not creepy or niche enough for arthouse or independent cinema movie houses, but also a little too real for average American movie goers who want to eat popcorn and sip Icees while watching this. I don‚Äôt recommend tripping on shrooms while watching this- weed alone would make it unforgettable. I‚Äôm extremely critical of films and Hollywood given who I am and this trailer alone means that sometimes Hollywood gets it right."

-_DJEzZk2pc,That dude is speed
-_DJEzZk2pc,Came here from the Motherless Brooklyn trailer. Comment section mentioned Phoenix as an Oscar contender. The trailer was incredibly well crafted and chilling. The emotionally incestuous nature of Joker's relationship with his mother especially disturbed me.  The unmitigated dysfunction of those scenes made you feel like someone pulled the curtain back ever so slightly and exposed the family's dirty secrets. I wonder how many psychopaths are created in this way?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The joker wasn't a psychopath, he's a sociopath, there's a difference. He's a product of his enviroment, society made him that way."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Im not feeling this . Because it seems it doesn‚Äôt fit a story with Batman . This is his origin movie there making an i know there gonna put him with Batman in another i can‚Äôt see how that‚Äôll mix he seems to ordinary an soft

That alone shows his dedication to this enigmatic character; by bringing more understanding to the Joker's personality. It may taint the pragmatic personality of the comic character; by giving an explanation, but at the same time the character should be more understandable and humane. That  could give a heart warming gift to the audience, by shifting fiction to reality; inhumane to  humane. As far as this has shown, we're in for something totally new! I'm sold"

-_DJEzZk2pc,A UN DIA DEL NUEVO TRAILER!üòçüòçüòç fuck!! Please!

-_DJEzZk2pc,This film looks fucked up.       Can't wait to see it
-_DJEzZk2pc,Trailer so fkn good
-_DJEzZk2pc,What happend to him falling into the huge vat of chemicals and thats what made joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Without a doubt, a better Joker than Jared Leto."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This youtuber just got 15 million views cause he uploaded the teaser trailer of  the movie JOKER.
I guess he is Lucky
Or a smart person to do so"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin is one of the greatest actors, maybe the best for this role of Joker this time. Before Heath's Joker version should have been Phoenix's one."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Without a doubt this is gonna be great.
Thanks producers for thinking of such an idea, making villains humans again. Villains are among us, THEY R US."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Background score is just amazing...what a trailer... can't wait to see this..,üòçüòçüòçüòçü§©ü§©ü§©"
-_DJEzZk2pc,We are Super excited for it chapter 2 more than joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,All it takes is one bad day...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"heath ledger will allways be my joker :(
miss him a lot"
-_DJEzZk2pc,The shots are are fucking amazing
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow...this feels like an incredibly authentic look into human misery.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Soon 1 Month left to this movie!! So excited! :D
-_DJEzZk2pc,heath ledger was meh. he was an emo clown for an emo audience.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Its it just me or its it getting crazier out there
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""If you just smile"" best quote"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel a bit darker just watching that. Cant wait!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,The world is getting crazier out there ... outside of Gotham city ...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"30 years later, Jack Nicholson hasn't a thing to worry about. This is the poor man's Joker. What rubbish."
-_DJEzZk2pc,That's why I fucking hate society they doesn't let to live happy life
-_DJEzZk2pc,Already better than Roberts Batman
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker spends half this trailer getting punched and/or tumbling end over end down stairs... great
-_DJEzZk2pc,almost forgot to watch this today
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Large number of people will consider him the best joker,if i'm wright i'm going to return after the movie and i'm going to remind you i was wright."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not at all matching the comic books
-_DJEzZk2pc,Chills
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Chills
Friggn CHILLS"
-_DJEzZk2pc,No one can replace ledger though
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I don't know why, but the part when he's in the diner with the lady and he smiles in a painful sort of way, I break a little. Like, I almost want to cry. I have no doubt this will be an amazing performance on his part and cannot fucking wait to see this movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm sorry but this is not the origin of The Joker.
Joker was a member of an organized crime gang in Gotham  before falling into a pool of acid or whatever after a fight with Batman in a factory,aside from left for dead and disfigured he became insane.
This may have ""Joker"" by name as the title to the movie and they may have Joaquin Phoenix dressed up in a clown suit but this is not Joker.
To think otherwise the real joke is on you."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I sense this is the joker we need that will bring back the feelings we had for heath ledger and jack Nicholson
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker arguably the greatest villain ever created. Nuff said.
-_DJEzZk2pc,AHHHHHH ! this looks so Good. BUT HEATH LEDGER he is Not. so hard to watch someone else trying
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please don't suck. Please don't suck. Please don't suck. Please don't suck. Please don't suck.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I Pre-ordered my Ticket Already
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I agree with the joker, we should burn money to find out that it was the only power we would ever have fought over. 

I agree with the joker, money was Batman‚Äôs greatest contradiction. 

It‚Äôs like Bruce Wayne wanted to be needed as a Hero. 

Otherwise he would have built a system that sustained providing to the needy. 

The jokers that this shitstem spawned, Batman only progressed himself from. 

Until he met his match."
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC makes better trailers than movies
-_DJEzZk2pc,2019?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Epic
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yoooo I can already tell he went crazy playin this role I love it!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I can't take this seriously, sorry"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This trailer was so genius, I'm afraid the movie won't live up to it! Can't.stop.watching."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can't wait anxious need another trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,"A  brand new take on joker
And an honest try
Praise Joachin Phoenix for  what I saw.. 
Hope the movie does justice...
Nothing on Ledger and jack Nicholson
But this is gonna be something fresh.."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"My favourite Villain.

Tribute to Heath Ledger"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"nicholson, ledger, Phoenix, the Joker deserves the best"
-_DJEzZk2pc,and the oscar goes toooooooooooo........................ Philip Seymour Hoffman
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'll be watching it in less than a week. Been eagerly waiting for this
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hindi dubbed movie world number one joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Can't stand most cape movies, but caught this trailer in the cinema. Just hope it's not gonna be the usual disappointment, because it looks epic."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I HAVE A FEELING THIS MOVIE IS GOING TO SUCK.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks amazing but will batman be in it they are enemys
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks dark....ü§òüòà
-_DJEzZk2pc,When is this coming out?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If you‚Äôre watching a 9 month old trailer, and the movie is still not out - that‚Äôs a problem ."
-_DJEzZk2pc,SuX!
-_DJEzZk2pc,2:16 That dance made me obsessed with it irl no joke
-_DJEzZk2pc,No lo se rick
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If this movie lives up to the trailer, then Joaquin is gonna take the movie limits and rewrite them"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Fucking amazing trailer, sooooooo good"
-_DJEzZk2pc,The feeling when you want the villain to destroy stuff
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I grew up with Cesar Romero as the joker.
Then Jack Nicholson took him to whole different level. Loved it
Heath Ledger dug even deeper into his role. And a much deserved Oscar.
Jared Leto had his own fantastic character. And in my opinion no one could have done it better.
I'm so looking forward to this one! 
Juaquin Phoenix is the absolute perfect actor for this role. I  agree with others that the trailer alone not only sold me but has just enough fright to scare millions. 
Hes a great role player, too. Sometimes that's a gift and a curse..
Already know I'm gonna love it"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Am I the only one that doesn't think it looks that good......
-_DJEzZk2pc,This trailer is enough to get nominated for an oscar
-_DJEzZk2pc,Shit I'v got a BONER!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I hope it will be dark, but I don't want to know before I'm actually watching it"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think Heath ledger put his foot on the joker but I‚Äôll give this a chance
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks stupid
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'll see your Avengers and raise you one Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I believe that the most appropriate candidate to play the joker is Mel Gibson. Somehow i feel like he has the craziness inside him,only need to be pushed out and presented in a role like this"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally I can route for the villain without my mom threatening to send me to councelingü§£ü§£ü§£
-_DJEzZk2pc,This guy will be the creepiest joker in history
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dark Knight's joker was the best
-_DJEzZk2pc,The joker has been immersed in chemicals products.  In this film he is immersed in society
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Oscar, Oscar, Oscar, Oscar, Oscar, Oscar, Oscar, Oscar, Oscar..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,RIP Heath Ledger.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This doesn‚Äôt look like someone who could beat up the terminator
-_DJEzZk2pc,the trailer itself is a masterpiece
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin Phoenix definitely lived it upto the mark of the Joker. Brilliant work. Sad reality though, even grown-up are bullied in the society"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Imagine the look on Jaquins face when he asks the caped crusader to ""take off his mask and reveal himself""....
And it's Russell Crowe as Batman:
""Son to a murdered father...son to a murdered mother...and I will have my vengeance in this life or the next!"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not all but some psychopaths are made the way they are by the very same society they end up burning down
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hurry up !!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks good, however, here's my problem: back when the Dark Knight came out, things were... calmer. The Joker was cool then, as he contrasted the sane and mundane. But nowadays there's a school shooting every other day, and a universal atmosphere of anarchy. Everyone's crazy now, so it's not cool anymore. It's like, if everyone owned a Lambo, Lambos wouldn't be exotic. I go to the movies to see something different, and that's why this movie isn't as relevant anymore. Because now, everyone's the Joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,And the Oscar goes to.....
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This trailer was better than the entire movie "" 47 Meters""...."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Knowing the joker's history.... How much you want to bet that the plot twist to this movie is that the entire story is just one gigantic lie after another?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can literally explain why this movie üçø can help increase the number of random mass shootings fam oml üí°üí≠üíØüíØ
-_DJEzZk2pc,This trailer got my anxious and excited at the same time.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks amazing! Can't wait!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can i just watch it now please? Trailer‚Äôs so good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Now with it having an ""R"" rating, they don't have to hold back!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This new joker seems like arkham game's joker and I fookin liked it. Maybe it was meant to be a game for child, I don't know, but in that game the developers throw some phylosophic studies and made me love deeply the character of the Joker. Here In Italy I can assure you that joker was born during the early 900 age under the name of Vitangelo Moscarda, the protagonist of "" 1, nobody, and 100.000 "" the book of Pirandello, an Italian literate. Him and Freud analyzed the essence of the mask that everyone of us put to stay in this mad society, and Vitangelo, like joker, after "" Seeing himself"" inside the mirror started to destroy  the "" Idea"" that everyone has about knowing Vitangelo. I pray for an excellent film."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm sick of DC hero's pissing there pants about killing supervillains. the only thing that changes in each movie is the cast.
JL don't put out fires, they always leave them lit. The highest ranked killers always get caught, beat up, thrown over Arkham fence, in a week they kill 10 guards escape and first thing on the news they killed 20 people right after they escape. So hero's with boy scout morals just continue the pussy process for yrs, knowing more people will die by keeping the worst killers alive. Living by this code makes the (""HEROS"") just as evil.
I CANT WAIT TO SEE THIS MOVIE."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The fact this is going to be Rated R. You can have my money. Was hyped, now even more hyped"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Heath Ledger, eat your heart out."
-_DJEzZk2pc,That laugh man ! Crazy
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Lazy victim biopic style background story for the joker,  90% of film is guy getting kicked about by life, final 10% is payoff for having to endure watching someone be a complete victim, where he turns into a psycho badass and gets revenge for what hes put through..  . .... Total dumpster fire...... but the shills will all cry for Phoenix to get a award for his so ""stylish "" interpretation of the joker......... films gunna be total trash!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I got the chills when this trailer first came out. 4 months later and I still got the chills. I could seriously watch this over and over. I can‚Äôt wait for the release. This movie is gonna be so fire. I can feel it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Look absolutely shite
-_DJEzZk2pc,so he gets on the talk show with robert de niro? i bet hes gonna gas the audience
-_DJEzZk2pc,He said ‚ÄúüÉè‚Äù
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC marketing is fucking trash this movie comes out in like two months and we haven't heard shit for four months they always do this ......
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger - that's the real Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:17 creepiest smile by any joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can‚Äôt wait
-_DJEzZk2pc,"*Check out this JOKER Teaser Trailer Parody! Its GREAT!!!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STR5xfnemSE"
-_DJEzZk2pc,R rating... I think thissa gon be gud
-_DJEzZk2pc,Jokers such a great character in super smash bros. Glad he's getting a movie as well.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hate clowns (not includoing The Joker) but I hate bullies even more..im not surprised he turned into a crazy psychopath
-_DJEzZk2pc,This needs to be a costume in mk11
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I expected the story of Jack Napier, rich director, turning into a monster after falling into chemicals.
What the hell is this one ??"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I really hope DC doesn't fuck this up
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I‚Äôm sorry but this it not look good, what happened to the one that doesn‚Äôt hid behind a mask, the joker is my favorite villain, but all it seems their doing is ruining it"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"As you know, madness is like gravity...all it takes is a little push."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is it just me or this movie looks kinda boring and lame
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hate it already and this is only the trailer. Prepare for the next big office bomb!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,First tears roll down my cheeks because I miss Heath's joker. Secondly a chill runs down my spine when Joaquin walks down the corridor from 2:07 to 2:11. Those 5 seconds are actually the true depiction of the chaos...RIP Heath...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I USED TO THINK MY LIFE WAS A TRAGEDY,ITS WAS A COMEDY love that dialogue"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks so shit!!! Smh
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,Who's here after mk11 üÉè
-_DJEzZk2pc,One would Wonder if Heath Ledger was still Alive would they give this role to him
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So is this the joker from dark knight , the jokers backstory ? . Or is it a completely different world and this joker is nt connected to Batman or anything ? ."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This and birds of prey???
-_DJEzZk2pc,"190,000 freaks gave this stupid film a thumbs up.... Bring back the insane asylums."
-_DJEzZk2pc,The only critique i have is what looks like him putting green dye on dark hair without bleaching first and it comes out bright green and pre bleached in the next shot...why you playing trailer if it was that easy i'd dye my hair all the time.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Doesnt look like  that great of a movie!
-_DJEzZk2pc,üëé
-_DJEzZk2pc,We never asked for a Joker movie! The Joker does not need his own standalone film. The Joker's real name is Arthur? Come on! His real name is never supposed to be revealed! This will critically flop like the Venom movie from last year. First a Venom standalone film with no connection to Spider-Man and now a Joker standalone film with no connection to Batman? This is bollocks!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Not long ago I watched the classic horror film Carrie for the first time since the 80s, this seems to be along the same lines but in reverse; an agonizing build up to the twisted yet righteous wrath, let the slow prequel boil begin..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can't wait...
-_DJEzZk2pc,The trailer + music = awesomeeeeee
-_DJEzZk2pc,Does this movie have a Batman?
-_DJEzZk2pc,the chills man the chills
-_DJEzZk2pc,When does it come out
-_DJEzZk2pc,I just wanna give him a hug
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joker: Gotham's lost its way



Batman: That's why you need me"
-_DJEzZk2pc,God is this trailer good...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks awful! Nobody gets this character right. The only version Hollywood got right was Jack Nicholson version. Jack played it perfectly and is still by far the best.
-_DJEzZk2pc,When will this movie release..?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I wanna see something like him killing his mom cuz she starts a dating a guy
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix.... What a great actor.... I know for sure he will bring the drama and the darkness to this film. Two thumbs up!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Is that that piece of shit Robert DeNiro ? Fuck him and anything he does. 
Drop dead DeNiro you fucking scumbag."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please don‚Äôt fucking ruin this DC
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I cannot stop watching this! When he laughs in the comedy club, it‚Äôs funny yet disturbing"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Man I think this is the PERFECT guy for this role!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It's weird to think his original last name is ""Bottom"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,Who else keeps watching this over and over
-_DJEzZk2pc,Normally I Don't Like D.C. movie's but this one actually looks so good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,2:09‚ùó
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is the first movie I am going to see in OctoberüòÅüòÉüòÄ
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy. That's how far the world is from where I am. Just one bad day."""
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I feel bad for Joaquin because even if he has an oscar winning performance, he will never beat Heath Ledger and his character will always be compared to Heath's."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I really don't like the new actor,I wish it was Jered Leto"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is sad
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:27 is the laugh I wanna go see
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks stupid
-_DJEzZk2pc,I gotta get a job.........
-_DJEzZk2pc,Juaquin is so good that this makes me root for the Joker. His life was full of tragedy and finally the demon woke up and started taking his revenge. I‚Äôve always found the joker fascinating but never rooted for him. Phoenix‚Äôs acting and portrayal has and always will be the best in the biz.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""If i have a past i prefer it to be multiple choice""  Joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is one of those rare movies I'm really looking forward to.
-_DJEzZk2pc,joker fan
-_DJEzZk2pc,If anyone can pull-off playing The Joker after Heath Ledger's performance it's Joaquin Phoenix
-_DJEzZk2pc,I pray to the gods this will be great ! Im so hype
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is the only reason DC is still alive
-_DJEzZk2pc,Despite being just the 13% of the population...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Legendary movie coming guys be ready‚ù§Ô∏è
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oohh I miss heath ledgers joker role so much üò¢ RIP
-_DJEzZk2pc,If the movie ends up being as good as this trailer then it will be one of the greatest or even the greatest comic book movie of all time
-_DJEzZk2pc,who's addicted ? show yourself !
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Always thought the Joker would have specialized military experience, especially the way he was depicted in the dark knight."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin is so incredible! This kind of role must take so much out of an actor
-_DJEzZk2pc,The whole thing about the joker is that his past is a mystery. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to me why they would make a movie to intentionally destroy the one thing about the joker that really sets him apart.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I don't usually care so much about how well made films are - if they make me feel, they make me feel. But this? holy fuck. This trailer alone is an absolute masterpiece."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I‚Äôm interested to see the direction that this movie takes the joker in, both appearance and character-wise. From the brief preview, he looks similar to the original joker in the comics, and I‚Äôm curious to see if they take the original comics into consideration for his character, or if they will take the joker in a separate direction, with just hints of other joker incarnations."
-_DJEzZk2pc,My favorite DC character. Jack Nicholson & Heath Ledger did great. I hope this film does it justice.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This movie will beat all the marvel movies 100%.




No offense to Marvel fans out there."
-_DJEzZk2pc,So fuk Willem Dafoe huh
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin looks like shit these days
-_DJEzZk2pc,"i really hope this movie doesn‚Äôt suck. Suicide Squad had a great trailer, but it didn‚Äôt reach up to it‚Äôs full potential. the film could‚Äôve been a masterpiece. i hope this movie isn‚Äôt anything like that"
-_DJEzZk2pc,read any book by Alice Miller b4 seeing this movie ü§®
-_DJEzZk2pc,.....................................................dude.
-_DJEzZk2pc,great !!!!! it will be a success .... i always enjoyed the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"August 18, 2019, anyone?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,He‚Äôs a very good actor
-_DJEzZk2pc,*Heath Ledger* is the best joker for all the time.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Jokers lack of origin is one of the key things that make Joker who he is. The unpredictability, pure chaos and insanity that is Joker is completely lacking from what this trailer portrays. I hope they crank the dial to 11 on the parts we haven't been shown because what this looks like is yet another bust in the DC franchise. STEP UP YOUR GAME!! Joker deserves better than this!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Que forma de cargarse un buen personaje
-_DJEzZk2pc,If this movie is as good as this trailer looks then it‚Äôd be a shame not to build the DC Cinematic Universe around it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Got chills watching the trailer. Masterpiece...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hats Off to Actor .
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hats Off to Actor .
-_DJEzZk2pc,There must be a film with Joaquin playing Charles Manson.
-_DJEzZk2pc,idk what got a bigger reaction outta me the trailer or the comments lol i must be born out of time or something cant relate to people these days back to my cave i guess until people stop being so feeble
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Can't stop thinking about the harvey dent quote from the dark knight: ""You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain."" when watching this."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I hope the movie isn't Joker getting his ass kicked for 2 hours, cuz this is what it looks like."
-_DJEzZk2pc,The movie isn't going to suck. I'm throwing that out there now. This is the BEST version of the Joker DC could've done.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This dc movie will burn the Hollywood
-_DJEzZk2pc,now I feel sad
-_DJEzZk2pc,I didn‚Äôt think this would be good until I saw the trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Please dont make this lhh 
the trailer just pissed me off dc and marvel need to keep their story lines same as comic books ""cringe dog"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The only other trailer I think I've watched this much is the X-Men Days of Future Past trailer and sometimes I still go back and watch that trailer. So even if this movie sucks, at least we'll always have this trailer."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Boring
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So when you find yourself locked
Onto an unpleasant train of thought heading for the places in your past where the screaming is unbearable, remember there's
Always madness.
Madness is the emergency exit.
By--- THE JOKER"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This movie reminds me of my favourite line in any song I have heard, ""with a song and dance, she lost romance, the world had gone insane"".  It's in a David Foster song from the movie, ""Stealing Home"" and if you saw the movie then you will understand the meaning of these words."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks creepy as f#ck.. can't wait for Joaquin phoenix interpretation.. damn..
-_DJEzZk2pc,Let's put a smile on that face
-_DJEzZk2pc,"My b day is oct 7 and this is oct 8 I‚Äôm watching this for my b day

Edit: it comes out oct 5

Another edit: I meant oct 4"
-_DJEzZk2pc,So basically mass killers in a nut shell. Ok
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh... It's DC... Yeah they'll find a way to fuck it up.
-_DJEzZk2pc,wtf is this garbage. I thought the joker who played in suicide squad would be doing a new joker. He was so damn good. This looks like some weirdo drama crap. I can tell it's total crap just from the trailer. All talk lame drama crap. Who the hell is this created for? what audience? 90 year old fans of batman from the 70's??? I am so confused by this crap right now.
-_DJEzZk2pc,unimpressive
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where is batman?  üòë
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I get the feeling the use of ‚ÄúGotham+Arkham‚Äùwill just be glossed quickly. His character and the movie as a whole will stand on it‚Äôs own without the inevitable,: ‚ÄúWTF IS BATMAN??‚Äù I Think.ü§îü§îü§îü§î"
-_DJEzZk2pc,this joker will beat the shit out of Robert Pattinson's Batman.....
-_DJEzZk2pc,Waiting for this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,I am truly excited for this movie. Hope the trailer isn't a trap as Suicide Squad's was
-_DJEzZk2pc,this will be biggest flop... every good trailer turn to flop movie...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is it release
-_DJEzZk2pc,Never thougt of Phoenix being the joker but my god what good casting
-_DJEzZk2pc,I first saw this trailer at the movies and came back here to watch it again
-_DJEzZk2pc,So has Jared Leto been replaced ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Well.That`s pretty interresting
-_DJEzZk2pc,cannot wait to NOT give this pile of doooo NO MONEY!!!!   really look forward to it! :)
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant, I remember how much I hated his character in Gladiator, looking forward to seeing this."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"because hey, why make an ORIGINAL movie, instead lets just vaguely plagiarize some comics and films, mash all the different origin stories together, and make money off complete shit."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"With a trailer this good, I don't know how they could fuck up the actual movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks amazing!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don‚Äôt think this can beat Heath ledger but I can try
-_DJEzZk2pc,This trailer is so good that it needs a comment.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I am so excited for this
-_DJEzZk2pc,Only the elite make comedy out of tragedy wake the fuck up. Sadness is not funny.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I miss camp and surreal superhero movies. The Joker should be an absurdist comedy film not this romantic realism thing. This type of ultra real interpretation makes it feel all the more fake.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks so bad.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Already the trailer is awesome!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I just realized at 1:23 the guys says ""what's so funny Jo-"". They cut off him saying Joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Really excited about his performance...not sure how I feel about the ‚Äúsociety made me do it‚Äù vibe, though. 
     Kids, take responsibility for your role and place in society. You ARE society."
-_DJEzZk2pc,It is reality ppl dnt like what they saw in this trailer because they r on that otherside which joker fight against.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""What version of the Joker is this?""
""Is this gonna be better than Heath Ledger's Joker?"" 
""What will this be connected to?""
It's its own thing - watch it like that."
-_DJEzZk2pc,NO! HOW DARE YOU MAKE THE POOR INNOCENT JOKER SAD AND THEN BEAT HIM UP! DIE!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is the best trailer I have ever seen. Joaquin is a genius.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"i have ""serious"" doubts that Todd Phillips can make a good movie...."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Last of US Fonts.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix is an excellent and humble actor. However this movie sucks. As someone who worked to finish it's all about being ok with and liking a person who is ready to destroy happiness. Enjoying his descent and hatred for what he feels created him. A selfish person that has a shit life and demands repurcussions for.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Future Oscar Best Actor!
-_DJEzZk2pc,So the director has said he is not basing this movie on the comics at all. So then what is the point of this movie?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I really do like what there doing making him into a sad clown. It really is a new take on him that I really dont think anyone has done. This is really interesting
-_DJEzZk2pc,The thing that is throwing me off about his Joker is the nose paint.  He needs to just have a white nose.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Society is the acid this time around !!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If you know more joker movies, please update me"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This movie as a start gives me the idea that it doesn't know what it wants. We've read that it's not based on the Joker in the comics. Yet from green hair to purple suit, from Arkham Hospital to Bruce Wayne and Thomas Wayne - everything references the Joker in the comics we know. So it's really about giving the Joker a kind of real world but very liberal spin and trying to show how the character came to be and could elicit our sympathy. Todd and Phoenix sure go through verbose lengths obscuring all that. Just call it what it is. And then let the audience judge. I think most would see the movie as something of one's descent into desperation and madness. But without Batman in it? It is doomed to fail."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope we get a ton of old music in this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This John Wayne Gacy movie looks fucking crazy.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"We already had Batman 2 and Batman returns about the Joker ! Can you stop copying and create now, Hollywood ?! Please, people, don't go see remakes ! Let them create new stuff."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Three words.....Robert .....De......Niro.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger !!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gotta say its already a million times better than Jared Leto's Joker!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Them: put on a happy face 
Me: *nah* *nahh*"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm sure he's a great actor and it will probably, hopefully, be a good movie, but I really am not warming up to the idea of him as J. But when I think about it, really I don't know if I've full on liked ANYONE who's played the Joker before. and before you be like ""beeeesh waaaah"" I'm only speaking cosmetically equivalent to the comics, not about talent. Nobody can do the comics justice. But none of this is stating that I disliked any Joker, movie, or the actors talent; it's very much the opposite. I love all of it. Especially the animated ones since they could do well with his look. But Idk, it's not that I care about appearance or whatever for shallow reasons, I just always see him as the skinny long faced crazy bug eyed huge mouthed tall guy because it suits him best and that's how he was when I was introduced and really nobody has that look. But man that'd be one sick movie to see if somebody actually did look like his crazy comic self! Regardless, I'm excited to see this. Couldn't come any sooner. =) Annnnnd yes I ramble when I speak of DC or Marvel, obvs, probably just need friends who actually like them! =P Difficult when I can only express myself through this crap.. XD so, not today trolls, not today."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger still has him beat by 1000 miles
-_DJEzZk2pc,Robert De Niro is in this. I will not see another movie with that anti-American scumbag. There is no room in America for people that hate America.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Like for Heath ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,they‚Äôre gonna make a new batman hopefully and it‚Äôs gonna have this joker. the movie ain‚Äôt even out but i feel like he‚Äôs gonna be the best joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,OMG
-_DJEzZk2pc,"White guys in suits beating up a clown laughing at my subway cart? Not buying it. Maybe if it was three black dudes, that‚Äôs something that would actually happen."
-_DJEzZk2pc,He is okay but why are they not using the joker from suicide squad. Batman with Ben aflect was stupid
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Has potential, but i doubt it'll be as good as heath ledger tho"
-_DJEzZk2pc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ-6PfWVDaU
-_DJEzZk2pc,This dude was Johnny cash 100%
-_DJEzZk2pc,I still think Leonardo DiCaprio would be the best Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I thought he turned to joker because of chemical exposure
-_DJEzZk2pc,SOME PEOPLE JUST DESERVE TO DIE. ENOUGH SAID.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hmm I can't think of a thing to say üòÇ
-_DJEzZk2pc,well i guess R.I.P. Joaquin Phoenix.. the joker claimed another one
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Well, it's a DC so it's gonna suck!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Give this man an Oscar
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joke MAKER. Psychopath from the 80s that lends inspiration to the real Joker...who will be The Batman and fight Battinson
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nice beginning üòÜüòÜ
-_DJEzZk2pc,Who else here after Peter griffin version
-_DJEzZk2pc,"At least 100 views from me. No ""joke"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,His smile is so disturbing
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker is the best character period
-_DJEzZk2pc,I want to see this movie so badly!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,WTF is this lackluster poor boring pile of horse shit? Nothing in this movie looks exciting or fun.
-_DJEzZk2pc,masterpiece ..its a masterpiece
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If you listen closely, and the train scene. The guy approaches him and says Joker but in the trailer it's cut"

-_DJEzZk2pc,"As good as this looks (I‚Äôll admit I had my doubts), I don‚Äôt want to feel sorry for the joker. The joker is a piece of shit, unapologetically so, that‚Äôs the appeal. His lack of back story makes him all the more sinister, another ‚Äúguy finally snaps‚Äù story just feels lazy"

-_DJEzZk2pc,I was hoping Jared Leto would play him
-_DJEzZk2pc,Very deep trailer. Before he embraced doing bad things he obviously had a heart . Dancing and bathing his mother shows he loved and cared so much for her and cared for others. But once society ran over him he decided to have a little fun .
-_DJEzZk2pc,I honestly feel bad for him

-_DJEzZk2pc,Clown man Joaquin.

I am not excited to this . DC cinematic still a trash."

-_DJEzZk2pc,Society deserves this for what they've done to him.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I love the symbolism with the stairs. A man trying to excel and be accepted walks up the stairs. The monster created from his descent walks down them.
-_DJEzZk2pc,And we wonder why our culture is sick. Hollywood is such a bore.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The society is the mad man. They twisted him, crushed him.

-_DJEzZk2pc,Well this explains everything
-_DJEzZk2pc,Was the little jump dance down the steps at the end a sneaky tribute to Heath Ledger? Heath did a very similar move in 10 things I hate about you.

-_DJEzZk2pc,Iv watches the trailer 6 times and I‚Äôm still not as hyped for this movie idk am I missing something ?? Iv been watching dc movies and shows for 38 years now and this to me is just like an average movie. I don‚Äôt c Phoenix getting me anymore excited for the film. Sorry I rather watch Wonder Woman or Micheal Keaton Batman

-_DJEzZk2pc,A DC movie with a good actor? I'm confused. No models in tights?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Only a little more than 2 months left, can't wait"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I get the chills
-_DJEzZk2pc,Robert de niro??? Can‚Äôt wait to see üòÅüòÅüòÅ
-_DJEzZk2pc,Smile!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Today is my first time seeing this. I was aware of it when it came out, I just didn't watch it for some reason.

I regret not watching it then."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"In any frame of this trailer no matter how slight, Joaquin's performance is genius. Every nuance, hand motion, footwork, and especially the eyes... tell a story of pain and transformation. Like Elvis and MJ we took something beautiful and destroyed it in the filth of our own weakness and greed."
-_DJEzZk2pc,100% sure the kid in the trailer behind the fence is Bruce Wayne
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hopefully turn around things for DC
-_DJEzZk2pc,"DC should make movies only on it's villains. Forget about the handsome hero who saves the day, do your own thing"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôll say it again; Worst joker EVER
-_DJEzZk2pc,""" i used to think that my life was a tragedy. but now i realize, its a comedy ""
i don't know but this line hurts so bad for me.

Edit: thanks for the likes."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think They would get Heath Ledger to play the joker again if he was still alive
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oscar best actor  2020 and the oscars goes to Joaquin poenix Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks promising.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think anyone who believes in freewill is going to have a hard time empathizing. Looks like the acting is going to be great though.
-_DJEzZk2pc,High hopes for this one.
-_DJEzZk2pc,If the movie is as good as the trailer...
-_DJEzZk2pc,No movies 2k19 will not have a african american main character in them
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks so gooooooooooood
-_DJEzZk2pc,The society is more brutal than the toxic waste!
-_DJEzZk2pc,The joker is also a victim.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This will settle the Marvel Vs DC war
-_DJEzZk2pc,So hyped
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks horrible
-_DJEzZk2pc,Garbage from my point of view..
-_DJEzZk2pc,Thank god another batman movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hey guys! Watch my new speed drawing video: Joaquin Phoenix aka the new joker!
-_DJEzZk2pc,when i first saw the trailer i thought it was about some crazy dude the gets bullied and ends up being good in the end but then joker came out i was like never mind üòÇ.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This looks like garbage,as expected,  and heath ledger was a shit joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,James Taylor's acting is perfect!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin Phoenix is 100% about to smoke this movie, I'm calling it now!!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin probably giving the best villian performance of this year. Hope he makes heath ledger proud.
Also what a brilliant soundtrack. Gave me shivers"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin's performance is already getting Oscar buzz.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The story of a man in mental pain due to cruelty of the society he lives in,worth a look see for sure. A different Joker than we have seen in TV and movies."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I know this movie is going to be amazing.  The trailer makes me feel so uncomfortable, but it's a good thing. Omg, I can't wait until it comes out."
-_DJEzZk2pc,But ohh how i wonder if he‚Äôll blow up buildings and go around shooting people?
-_DJEzZk2pc,His laugh is exactly how you would read it
-_DJEzZk2pc,"sorry but i never liked heath ledger's joker, and i'm fucking loving this joker!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Even this Guy cant beat the real joker Heath Ledger RIP. Best Joker Ever in the scene of acting.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie will bomb! He is the last person that should be playing this part!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Whoever made this trailer deserves a blowjob every day for the rest of his life.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Jack Donaghy
-_DJEzZk2pc,Blec Aaldwin
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I think that giving Joker a name and origin, giving him a human form, making him ""used to be a normal guy"" destroys the uniqueness of the Joker character. So I consider this highly non-canon.
BUT, seeing this story of a man snapping, going fully mad, just because the world is mad and the only sane answer is being insane - this will be brilliant and I know I will watch it over and over again. Because this is what every one of us wants to do at certain points in life - just break from the stupid social conventions and let everyfuckingone feel our lunatic pain.
This pretty much reminds me of Falling Down and American Psycho. Hope it will have lots of dark comedy in it."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Put on a happy face, world."
-_DJEzZk2pc,this movie is dumb no justice to the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,It doesn't give you the same hipe as a Marvel movie but i guess i'll watch it. Ou well... üôÑüôÑüôÑ
-_DJEzZk2pc,I have no doubt... it will be an extraordinary interpretation and film
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I literally still get the chills every time I watch the trailer and it's not my first time looking at it. 
I'm so excited for this, DC is finally showing what it should, cold truth, no jokes, no target for money just entertainment"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Am enjoying this trailer,I can't wait to watch the full movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,As a die hard batman fan i am going to skip this movie its nothing like the original joker. The gotham tv show thoroughly botched the batman storyline but that can be chalked to the multiverse scapegoat that dc is known for. This on the other hand is nothing more than trying to reinvent an already perfect character. Joker is an unknown person and all that is ever really known is that he had a pregnant wife he had no job and he was desperate for money when he got dressed as red hood and later turned into joker by accident. He wasn't a clown before hand and this makeup which looks nothing like joker is just a piggyback design cause it chapter 2 is coming out so thwy just trying to push the scary clown image. Joker is by all accounts perfect as a character as a villain and has the best origin one could ask for for a villain. I will not waste any time watching this in theaters or on home video. People need to leave well enough alone before it ends up being another fiasco like the MCU let happen by letting Disney get their hands on it. There should be people well versed in the comics that they make movie adaptations of especially long standing famous characters. It is a big fuck you to the fans when we have to listen to people spout off nonsense they think is canon because they saw it in a movie. So lets put it out the infinity war is way off base spiderman far from home is bull**** mysterio has always been a spiderman villain never an ally. There was no guardians of the galaxy during the infinity war. Hela is loki's daughter and loki is thor's brother. So if you want the infity gauntlet story read thanos quest 1&2 to see how he got the stones its a better story and then read infinity gauntlet to see how it should've went. As far as joker read the killing joke to learn what has been revealed about joker and his past. Sorry for the rant but I can't keep quiet about bad comic movies any longer thanks for reading my comment.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Don‚Äôt give a shit. I. Can. Not. Wait . To see this movie. Joker should be the most devious broken psychotic character ever. And if this isn‚Äôt R rated and show that with a realistic crazy view. I will be mad. F**k if they don‚Äôt do that. This has sooooo much potential. I have honestly never been more hyped for the potential for a movie!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks dumb but I'll watch it just to confirm
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath ledger would be proud
-_DJEzZk2pc,Marvel fans disliked the trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,Waiting
-_DJEzZk2pc,Really wish Heath was arround to play this role
-_DJEzZk2pc,Just watch.. I will be as great as him
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is going to be so fucking stupid.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Miedo y una tristeza profunda es lo que me ha causado a mi ...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hiii
-_DJEzZk2pc,im waiting for this
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally something for adults with real actors !!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why is this so relatable?
-_DJEzZk2pc,WHY SO SERIUS ???
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It's undoubtedly the case, that had Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker not been so devastatingly good, we would a. continue to have a bad, almost cartoonish, caricatures of the joker, and b. Not have had this movie and it's dark, serious portrayal by JQ - who must be said is up to the task"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It looks like DC might have got it right finally, if the directing is anything like the trailer suggests we finally get the winner we've been waiting for since the Batman franchise"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Head Ledger Will be the Best joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The GODZILLA king of the monsters trailer was badass.  Then, i went to watch it and it was a sorry ass movie.  That's the trend now in hollywood now, they put in a lot of work into making a great trailer to attract you, but totally forget about making a good movie"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please!!! DC!!!  DONT fuck this up!!!!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Only two things are limitless, universe and people's stupidity."
-_DJEzZk2pc,River would be proud
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can't wait till that movie comes out
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin's portrayal of the Joker might very well be the best of them all.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I come here when I need to smile.. .
-_DJEzZk2pc,When did Joaquin Phoenix turn into Daniel Day Lewis?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Put on a happy face!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"2009: Joker win

-_DJEzZk2pc,2:10.... you fucking feel that?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Jokes on us
-_DJEzZk2pc,The part where there‚Äôs the people with the clown masks on is very interesting
-_DJEzZk2pc,oh no.

-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks like a trailer for a cheap TV show.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Anyone notice the sign was broken before it hit him in the face. But still way awesome
-_DJEzZk2pc,Already putting disclaimers out is a bad sign
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's titled JOKER.....but Todd Phillips and Jaquin Phoenix are saying it's not a joker movie!!!! Any answers!!!???
-_DJEzZk2pc,Jaquin phoenix.said we won't be happy...about this!!! ....
-_DJEzZk2pc,He has said it a lot... WTF!!!....Thomas Wayne is running for Mayor of Gotham...it ultimately is a Batman/ joker movie...ur not getting an Oscar!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why title it joker..if juaqin Phoenix says it not joker???...all I c is him saying joker fans will not be happy??
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wtf. This looks great. Like it could be unlike anything a comic movie has done before. I thought I was over DC. It only figures that Joaquin Phoenix would be the one to draw me back in.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Robert De Niro , really? Kevin Spacy was not available?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I had no faith in Joaquin or this movie at all but this changed my mind. Pretty sure he's going to be great as the joker, not as much as Heath but still."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Why would anyone want to watch this? - ""We didn't follow anything from the comic books, which people are gonna be mad about,"" Director Todd Phillips, who also wrote the script, said in the interview. ""We just wrote our own version of where a guy like Joker might come from. We're not even doing Joker"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not feeling this movie at all
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is something for far left nut jobs.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It's awesome when you can find proof that art can be more real than reality, like in this trailer."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"i have high hopes for this movie, don‚Äôt fw my joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I am still waiting for movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,This will be sucks. This is not joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow! This is a movie I cannot wait to watch! There's been so much crap out there for years now that I stopped going to the movies long ago, but I think this ones getting me out to the theater when it's released."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Going against the norm here - but if this is teasing the best bits to entice me to see it - it failed. It seems rather boring.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is so freaking sad
-_DJEzZk2pc,One smile rule the world üåé
-_DJEzZk2pc,Glad im not a dc fan. This is the worst dc movie ever. No effects no super no fun. Fucking dc fans.........xbox fans.......star wars fans........feel sorry for these losers.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin is such a great actor, my God."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This shows villains aren't born they're made ;(
-_DJEzZk2pc,The drama/tragedy is strangely captivating but I'm not sure if I could watch a whole movie like this. I tip my hat to Joaquin Phoenix though for sure üòäüëç.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Un lien pour iam still here
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Dc movies background sounds is just awesome in every movie. 
Specially in wonder woman ‚ô•"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I like this but it's missing something for me I don't like seeing the joker get beat up I like seeing him beat other people up and he having a gang like in the dark Knight
-_DJEzZk2pc,give this trailer 10 oscar NOW!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Marvel Or Dc? Marvel Like,Dc Comment"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this rated R
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks STUPID  ASF
-_DJEzZk2pc,Am I not merciful?? :D
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks sad
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Makes sense why he and Batman never kill each other.... they both empathize for one another.  We sure are going to need a D.C. revival considering ""Phase 4"" Marvel lineups."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Saldr√° otro trailer ??
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dont like it at all.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I am pretty sure, Pheonix will not disappoint. Looking forward to this movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The original Joker was a conniving, opportunistic character. Why was he  transformed into a soulless, hateful one?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Idk man.. just don't know
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I KNEW IT! When they announced Joaquin Phoenix some of my friends belittled him, but THIS is a Joker! It's not Jack Nicholson, it's not Heath Ledger (RIP, mate), it's Joaquin F-ing Phoenix. I KNEW he can get into this character!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,When is this coming out tho
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix?!  Really??  What the hell?  The ball has been dropped and this movie will FLOP!  They will regret not casting Jerrod Leto for this. He was great in Suicide Squad and he left me wanting more Joker in that movie.  It‚Äôs so sad when you know a casting director sucks at their job and casts possibly the worst actor for a certain role like this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This better not be an antihero story. I want to see him transform to a heath ledger joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I dont think this movie will be what people are expecting.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"0:51 For a second, he looked like the legendary Heath Ledger right there."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I get him.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can‚Äôt help but think this role was always meant for Willem Dafoe.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This one is going for Oscars !! Like if you agree
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I don't feel too bad about this guy, at the end he gets that hot harlequin girl."
-_DJEzZk2pc,He king of comedy but he‚Äôs slightly crazier
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I don't like the 'bullied victim turns psycho' take on the joker. It's too realistic and... Kind of uncreative. Would have prefered to see a darker side of his past, like his abusive father that was mentioned in the dark knight, or something similar."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Release date?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks good! You can tell he‚Äôs a great actor! May even be nominated for his performance!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Beautiful trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wait so is this part of the DCEU
-_DJEzZk2pc,He has the best joker laugh I've seen in a while
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Richard Brake (Doomhead from the movie 31) would of made a really good Joker as well, if you watch his scenes in the 31 movie, you would definitely understand, he was amazing in that movie even when the movie was kind of shit hahaha üòÇ. Joaquin Phoenix looks like a very good actor to play Joker as well though üòä I'm excited to watch this!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I love the Joker üÉè he is one of my favourite villains. Would be really good to learn his life experiences and what made him like that.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is why you don‚Äôt fuck with people
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I though he evil,coz batman his enemy..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"That‚Äôs how it starts...

The fever
The rage
The feeling powerlessness
Which turns a good man...
Cruel."
-_DJEzZk2pc,the hair reminds me of max cady.
-_DJEzZk2pc,i just want him to kill all those motherfukers that made him become the crazy guy we saw back in the Chrstopher Nolan's series. I really wanna see him destroy all those maggots that go around and in the end are the real bad guys...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is that same stair exorcist where father jump window
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I love Phoenix's tired expression climbing the long uphill stairs and going down happy and dancing, a perfect metaphor of the story"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"In all seriousness, this is the best trailer I've ever seen. The music is stunning, orchestrating his metamorphosis and ties it together masterfully. Wow!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,ESSE FILME VAI SER √ìTIMO
-_DJEzZk2pc,"if i had to give my mom a bath, i would become the joker too"
-_DJEzZk2pc,No me gusta el otro joker üòßüò°üò°
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sorry guys I don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs so special about this trailer all I see is a man going SANE in a crazy world
-_DJEzZk2pc,"1:09 to 1:10 He look the camera, hard to see. Try to stop the video."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I come back to this trailer every couple of days it's epic
-_DJEzZk2pc,"madness is like a gravity, all it takes a little push @ 02:15"
-_DJEzZk2pc,actually looks good and dramatic
-_DJEzZk2pc,All it takes is just one bad day...
-_DJEzZk2pc,People turning bad because they have a reason...
-_DJEzZk2pc,If they ever remade The Crow............
-_DJEzZk2pc,What???
-_DJEzZk2pc,The first joker was good
-_DJEzZk2pc,If joker had options why would he be himself.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Whoever you are, whatever you are, wherever you are, whatever your race, background,  gender, orientation, religion or lack thereof, creed, nationality...Hold your ground. I know it's crazy out there, and you want to do the right thing...You can, you have. Fuck the creeps, keep on being you, and reaching to the light. The angels are on our side. The demons too ;)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Commodus when he found out he wasnt emperor of rome
-_DJEzZk2pc,Just one bad day...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not impressed!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I can't help but see Bill Murray's ""Quick Change"" watching this.  Not a bad thing, If Bill took on more macabre roles easily."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I actually just saw this trailer tonight when going to see Once Upon A Time In Hollywood...this trailer BLEW ME AWAY. I was there opening night for Heath Ledger in ""The Dark Knight"" and he was utterly phenomenal. Iconic. But Phoenix looks JUST as iconic in his own bizarre and brilliant way. A fascinating interpretation of the Joker and actually very serious and emotionally complex from what I can see here. I also like the makeup just a bit more than Ledger's, I admit."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wuts the rating?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"We are all madmen, if not, we soon will be. This society is our asylum."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think this movie will be boring.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Who would have thought. Humans are waste. It‚Äôs ok, blame god, he gave you to them joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,ILY JOK3EDD3DRR4RRRR DONT BULLY JOKKERRRRE >>>>>>:::::::((((((
-_DJEzZk2pc,immediate goosebumps
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please God !! Allow Joaquin to win the Oscar üôè lol
-_DJEzZk2pc,from scene 07:11 to scene 07:18 ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. Chills . Here I thought I was tough guy.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Christ I hope this film is as good as the trailer makes it look .
-_DJEzZk2pc,Best trailer I have ever seen ...
-_DJEzZk2pc,shitbad retarded
-_DJEzZk2pc,Music at and from 2:11
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can‚Äôt wait to not watch this retarded shit.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I think this is going to be about how an average, maybe poor guy(Joker) gets bullied by people with power and money. Law enforcement is corrupt. And he has a mental illness anyways, but the bullying and corruption makes him snap turning him into Joker. Because if you notice, the people bullying him are clean cut, maybe people with money and power."
-_DJEzZk2pc,i think naw we can feel some of joker pain but alweys put smaile
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is a beautifully tragic story. This movie is going to be the best one yet. To really make u understand the joker. And they stuck very close to the original comic book story.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie is going to suck..
-_DJEzZk2pc,I watch this too much
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie is for all who loves their mom and has been bully and break out in their own way
-_DJEzZk2pc,"To get audiences to somehow sympathize with one of the most diabolical, deranged and evil characters to ever exist... hire Joaquin Phoenix."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It looks like this movie will inspire some real life actors, And that‚Äôs a concern..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow. Makes me feel sad , but it‚Äôs an amazing trailer."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think this movie is going to bomb.  I think they've messed up the Joker.  This has a 1998 Godzilla look to it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow, that movie looks really shit! I'm bot sure what the point of the trailer is?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,one of the best trailers I've ever seen
-_DJEzZk2pc,That falsetto laugh at 1:09 coming from a grown man is easily the most disturbing thing in this entire trailer.
-_DJEzZk2pc,this guy brings a totally darker vibe to the joker. lets hope they use him in a future batman movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"After the Dark Night i thought It never cant get any better. 
Oh Lord im so stupid"
-_DJEzZk2pc,You are a legend #Joaquin Phoenix. You are!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,whenÔºü
-_DJEzZk2pc,Already should be an academy award winner from just the trailer! Marvel is dead to me
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now we just need a decent Batman

-_DJEzZk2pc,I can't wait to see this goddamn movie. I hope to god it's awesome!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I started a joke/Which started the whole world crying
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Could people please stop bashing Jared? how could you Heath and the others were basically legends for their Joker laugh, that's what made them unique, you can't SERIOUSLY suspect him to live up to that, I mean like~...come on! not to be rude but I bet half of you can't even manage to do Jared's version of the Joker laugh (Which I actually like and view as funny) but you all are so eager to bash the poor fella for at least trying to make the laugh sound psychotical (As it does, to me.), I mean~ Jared probably isn't or wasn't used to playing the psycho killer/mafia leader role and was trying to make it sound natural as possible."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Huge Phoenix fan but totally unimpressed by this trailer. DC hasnt let me down in recent years, I imagine it‚Äôs much better than it looks"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Anyone remembering heath ledger after watching this trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,This will probably be good but I don't like the mythos  of the Joker just being a social outcast that was bullied growing up...serial killer 101 basically..meh
-_DJEzZk2pc,I luvd the 2:16 part
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Fans: we want a joker movie.
America 2019:  ok but everyone is a victim these days. so was Joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I really hope this is amazing, and they can finally get a good start on a ""universe"" out of it. DC has so much to offer, and dare I say even more than Marvel. They just fail to execute almost always, the only thing they did right was the Nolan Batman Trilogy and casting Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn.  This looks so promising, and Joaquin is an amazing actor, I have high hopes."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I love the movie already. Who else is going to cry to this movie with me? Looks like he goes through a lot of pain, suffering and bullying here.. so sad, but he has to put on a happy face. I can relate."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Guess taxi driver and psycho was a bit of inspiration for this
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Funny but I just now noticed the double meaning of big words saying ""THIS FALL"". 

It only went over my head the first 30 times I've seen the trailer."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Omg he scares me. I run like hell if I saw him down the hall. üòÇ
-_DJEzZk2pc,Damn gives me chills everytime I see this trailer

Anyone actually read his note pad?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Okay, I don't get it. Yes, the trailer is good but you can't just take a character that has been developed cinematically over decades and just tear up his back story and start again. Makes no sense to me. This is not the joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin is one of his generation's most intense and brilliantly talented actors. I have never been all that keen on the entire Batman series aside from the campy TV show of my childhood. That said, Heath Ledger was amazing in his Oscar-winning role before he passed. But Mr. Phoenix? He will be sublime in every aspect. I will see this film on the strength of his art alone. Looking forward to this with great anticipation."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Am i the only one who wanted to see Jared Leto, but thinks that this is ART too ?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Omg, can‚Äôt wait to see this."

-_DJEzZk2pc,And DC fuck up again he doesn‚Äôt even act like the joker  if heath was still alive he would be perfect for this part This movie going suck not going see it  maybe if DC just sign over their company to Disney and they probably have better movies and actors to do the part
-_DJEzZk2pc,"DC fanboys wanted mature and gritty, well, here you go. Enjoy. LMFAOOOOO"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is how I think DC movies should be. Not Shazam or the other ones that came out.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"What if they ended up giving us an actual comedy and just made the trailer look dark? Lol, that'd be great."

-_DJEzZk2pc,And yet they will find a way to muff it up
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It seems that the character here is marginally retarded & slightly illiterate as opposed to the genius of the original, and past films, 'Joker'. Phoenix looks the part so I'll reserve my final judgement until after I've seen the film."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This looks freaking dope, but is anyone else nervous that we are trying this again through Warner Bros which gave us the LetoJokerFiasco? I have a video on this that I literally just made so if you wanna talk about expectations for this upcoming film, check it out."

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Is this joker a good guy 
Or is he still evil?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oscars sure
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is going to suck! Should have just left the joker alone.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Bruh this isn't the jokers back story at all this actually is garbage and besides he makes a terrible joker wtf this movie is actually retarded fuck I could've been a better joker and made a better movie with a better back story with the same elements or even different ones. I'm sorry but I absolutely love the joker but this... This isn't the joker. It's mainstream garbage.

-_DJEzZk2pc,Amazing !!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,i feel sad for him
-_DJEzZk2pc,All these cringy ass 13 year olds in the comments saying they can relate to the joker lmao
-_DJEzZk2pc,the worst part about having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don't:)
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Don't have any doubt Phoenix will play the hell out the role & leave an impression but NO ONE, I repeat, NO ONE will ever define that role better than Heath Ledger."
-_DJEzZk2pc,What a time to be alive
-_DJEzZk2pc,the gravitas of the energy in this film is so clearly cleanly intensely coming through in the trailer makes it feel like its a 1950's epic masterwork that will win 20 awards...Joaquin is the bomb that will explode and we will all go ahhhh with satisfaction...it has pure raw TRUE electricity and we are all feelin it!

Instead of building on the existing DC world they've created and giving Jared Leto the chance to tell this story, a group of hipsters sitting around a table with charts of demographics and the mistaken idea that Phoenix is 'edgy' as opposed to 'limited' decided to make a millennial version of Taxi Driver meets One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest by way of The King of Comedy! This is why I hate Hollywood!"

-_DJEzZk2pc,Batman 6: the hospice of death. Batman in his 80s fighting off joker in the cafeteria with a battarang from the box under his bed that's duck taped to his grabber. And joker just wheels on over in his chair and punches him in the dick and trys to do his joker laugh but hacks up blood half way through due to his cancer. And robin just lies there lifeless in life support. The penguin tosses an umbrella at the cord and unplugs it

Love Joaquin Phoenix!!!!‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§"

-_DJEzZk2pc,So weird seeing an origin story for the joker. That being said it looks like it's going to be really cool.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I do not know if this movie becomes flop or hit but this movie will be a landmark which will remain on everybody's heart ...
-_DJEzZk2pc,When the first picture of this joker went around I was pretty sceptical and didnt really like the look. But after seeing this trailer a few times I'm actually pretty excited for this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The trailer is just amazing, I can already tell that this movie is going to be good. I am not surprised that this'll come out on October. Joaquin Phoenix is perfect for this role. I think we're going to enjoy this movie when it comes out. üëå"

-_DJEzZk2pc,NO. NO! FUCK THIS! STICK TO THE RIGHT STORY! DON'T REWRITE WHAT WE ALREADY LOVE! YOU'VE SUCCESSFULLY RUINED JOKER!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is the the way a real person  would be villain joker with the make up and not getting work to make money and how people would be haveing with him and not from falling into liquid to make him look like the joker that can not happen  to anyone in real life  this does not do that and that is what makes it different movie

-_DJEzZk2pc,Honestly I am so excited for this movie. Like YES I want to see how the Joker slowly went mad. Not just fell into a huge vat of chemicals. I think this will be a great psychological thriller.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This Joker will kick Robert Pattinsons twinkly little fairy ass
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is more of a Dramatic Joker not the same anarchy joker Heath Ledger played but still Joaquin Phoenix is a Oscar Nominated actor and I think this movie is gonna do wonders.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Okay, finally going to put this out there....is he got something going on with his mother? Was that her he was bathing and dancing with? If that's the case, have at it, but just wondering if that's what I'm seeing?"

-_DJEzZk2pc,I like how the Joker takes off his mask when the police said he is a coward who does the bad case with a mask
-_DJEzZk2pc,"just 2 mins into a trailer and we are empathetic towards the joker already. the same joker that our beloved and incorruptible batman is against. really, we are exactly the society that joker wants to fuck in the ass!"

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Okay, DC's hard-on for the Joker I feel has run it's course. All things being equal I'm hoping they come up with a valid reason for how he became a murderous sociopath. Because if the only reason they're giving is emotional duress...that's bullshit. I would know."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wont be watching that now i know that faggot DeNero is in it.

-_DJEzZk2pc,Wtf is this ü§®
-_DJEzZk2pc,Honestly this trailer looks promising and I‚Äôm sure Joaquin Phoenix will be a great Joker. BUT in my opinion Joker works the best when he‚Äôs in a story with Batman. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me but I feel like that‚Äôs one of the best parts of Joker is seeing him fuck with batmanüòÇ If they made a movie with Ben Affleck Batman and Joaquin Phoenix Joker I would shit myself

This trailer says it all: the man is slowing giving into his own insanity because he's done with going along with what society tells him to be. He's done with being seen as ""normal"", and he's creating for himself an image that represents anarchy and breaking every rule in the book. This is hands down one of the movies I'm most excited to see this fall"
-_DJEzZk2pc,STOKED!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,The song tells the Joker's story right there but what is the Joker's real name? Jack Napner? Right! This looks good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,No one will top heath ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie is going to be top tier for this year.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"To paraphrase Nietzsche, ""Society is merely the spiritualization of cruelty."" Finally they made a film about this."

-_DJEzZk2pc,Trailer is meaningless
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The older Joaquin Phoenix gets, the more he looks like musician James Taylor. ü§î"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The opening to this trailer is disturbing and dark to start when the therapist asks him ""does it help to have someone to talk to""? When his face switches moods"

-_DJEzZk2pc,"If the rumor proves to be true; THAT rumor being that DC has officially accepted this movie's ""backstory"" for the Joker from here forward.  Then I can only imagine how powerful of a portrayal Mr. Phoenix has developed.  The significance?  DC will not to be telling the filmmakers how to craft they're movie. Oh no, rather the filmmakers will have the. Transcended their artform an will have then given birth to the original creators of Detective Comics, Bob Kane and his just recently credited co-creator"

-_DJEzZk2pc,he looks like he lost so much weight for the movie :(
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow, they're trying to actively glorify John Wayne Gacy!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I always told myself joker had to have had a really sad back story and not some i got thrown into a toxic waste in order for me to go nuts and hate everyone its because of everything going on around him and eventually he got used to this incredible madness and smiled at it all so dont go thinking he's completely insane cause it made sense from his experience and life to top this all off he accepted this madness so he already understood both sides of the stick plus it looked like a horror show all the more reason I love villains who u think is a bat shit crazy person till u COMPLETELY understand its too bad that this sort of thing aint noticed until the end and then you realize he was nothing but a good guy only trying to help you smile through all that pain n just keep pushing forward because if you couldnt you will end up being the saddest person ever so why dont you just put a smile on that face of yours and spread it to others? besides it never hurts to smile every once in a while. :D

-_DJEzZk2pc,Dam I wish Heath ledger was still alive the best üÉè
-_DJEzZk2pc,Funny or not. The Joker movie is making me think like this is how Toffee (SVTFOE) came to be. Not as an insane clown that is.
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's not like he has no pain to channel into the character his brother did die.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks stupid u go from an amazing heath ledger joker to this crap  not even in the same league sry Joaquin pheonix but no üëé
-_DJEzZk2pc,the best DC movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is sad gothem sucks one like to make joker happy
-_DJEzZk2pc,Leonardo Dicaprio would have played this role a lot better than Phoenix.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I can feel it,, an OSCAR awards for this film"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is so Noir I love it. Noir is by far the best film style who agrees?

-_DJEzZk2pc,"batmen joker is best

-_DJEzZk2pc,That doesn't really seem like the joker we all know
-_DJEzZk2pc,No one will take the place of heath ledgers
-_DJEzZk2pc,He s gonna be better than Heath Ledger I believe
-_DJEzZk2pc,I thought it looked lame at first but the more I see the trailer the more I want to see it. It actually looks like it has potential.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow I can't wait to see this movie, excitement makes me hungry xD.. watch this link https://ckk.ai/cymB for those who loves Jollibee style Spagheti."
-_DJEzZk2pc,it is not a movie its just a real truth.....
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Heath ledger's joker gets his scars from his father, his father says, ""why so serious, let's put a smile on the face"". 

My theory says Heath ledger's joker is son of this pheonixs joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I have absolute faith in Joaquin, he is a phenomenal actor."
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:08 that joker laugh
-_DJEzZk2pc,Welp I‚Äôm watching this movie

-_DJEzZk2pc,....I'm not sure what did I just watch...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Man they could have done this so much better.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Giving context behind the joker will kill his character. The whole point and awesomeness to some characters is the mystery and the unknown for the reader to guess and never have a clear answer as to why
-_DJEzZk2pc,#notmyjoker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Get This Man Oscars ! 
Yeah Oscars ! One isn't Enough!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,0:41 looks like he got hit in the nuts. Based on the way he is holding himself
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm sure the movie will be great quality wise but I don't like the Joker just going crazy cuz his life went to shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:28 is a *masterpiece*  üò≠
-_DJEzZk2pc,You know a movie's going to be great when the actors creep you out about how good of a job they did casting their role. This should be a great follow up to Ledger's performance.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don't like where that scene with the flowers is going.....
-_DJEzZk2pc,This shows perfectly how much of a society we live in. Gamers rise up!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hell no still Heath Ledger FOREVER!!!! Movie dosent look that great but whatever im sure ill go see it anyways just for something to do üòÇüòÇüòúüòú
-_DJEzZk2pc,I respect joaquin.... But i really wanted to see jared jeto on this... Man... Its kinda disappointing but due to my fandom i will see it eventually but i wont go to it in theaters... I refuse with leto i refuse
-_DJEzZk2pc,What‚Äôs that song called?
-_DJEzZk2pc,How hard is it to make a movie about a failing man that got dropped the Vat of chemicals got his skin bleached and couldn‚Äôt find a job as a rodeo clown Gotham‚Äôs joker was the best one I‚Äôve seen lately .I didn‚Äôt like  Heath ledger Either
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sad I feel the same as him

-_DJEzZk2pc,IMD says this has been nominated for a golden trailer award.
-_DJEzZk2pc,‚ÄúI thought my life was a tragedy but I now realize it‚Äôs a comedy‚Äù
-_DJEzZk2pc,After seeing this I think he would make an even better actor if they ever did a remake for the crow !!
-_DJEzZk2pc,The psychological atmosphere in this Trailer is so good
-_DJEzZk2pc,We Live In A Society
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is fake joker. Joker 2008 is real

-_DJEzZk2pc,April fools MF!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joker's motto is: 'If you can't beat them, join (Laugh at) them.'"
-_DJEzZk2pc,When did Norman Bates become the Joker?
-_DJEzZk2pc,FYI phoenix has been preparing for Joker since 09
-_DJEzZk2pc,Damn this is gonna be good
-_DJEzZk2pc,"2008 better he looks like the joker this guy looks like a normal clown not like the features the joker has and the real joker was thrown in acid not into society i bet this one wont even kill enyone not with a gun or laughing gas egleast with....


Dancing...."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I have a feeling that he will fall into acid towards the end cause they announced this wasnt his final look
-_DJEzZk2pc,Man. I really hope the full length film is as great as the trailer is. Joaquin was born for this role.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Guys, the craziest part about this is that Joaquin Phoenix actually has mental health issues- playing this role is going to be straight up real life art. He'll win an Oscar for this performance."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Mental illness. Curse to the person. Curse to those that don't help the person. The brain is ........
-_DJEzZk2pc,Holy crap!!!! DC May have just made up for justice league! Lol üòù

-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm a man with a clown face. All don't know my physco rage begins. I have a monster under the bed. All this time it's me who is THE MONSTER.

-_DJEzZk2pc,Didn‚Äôt notice this movie it looks good btw
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It will get him a ""Oscar"" for this kind of class acting."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow, I did not even realize that was Joaquin Phoenix - he seems perfect for the role. I can‚Äôt wait for this movie!
A more believable take on ‚ÄúThe Joker‚Äù and how society can fail a human being."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not a match of heath ledger though
-_DJEzZk2pc,"finally, a chance for DC to redeem itself"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I really wanted to be a joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can‚Äôt wait to see this Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks good but that's not how the Joker was made?
-_DJEzZk2pc,He will be the best joker ever. The best villain ever. Joaquin is one of the best actors of our time.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Cerita apa benda ni tk paham
-_DJEzZk2pc,WOW....

I always thought joker was bad
but he's nice, people are bad to him tho"
-_DJEzZk2pc,üôè-Never forget heath ledger-üôè
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The Joker is a tragic character and nobody helped him society saw him as a joke. Its just me or is it getting crazier out there! He isn't crazy he just tried to make it in society and he couldn't nobody liked him and he got the laugh and its creepy how the Joker becomes insane and crazy and people call him a freak and a loser. Gotham lost its way. Yeah Gotham lost its way when you have someone hiding behind a mask who was to get back at society for what they did to them. The Joker's life is a tragedy and it shows him as crazy. He kinda looks like Heath Ledger a bit!¬† A child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to finally feel its warmth!"" Sounds like my story! Your¬†a joke, no friends no family you have nothing you are nothing! A lot like me!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Just one word... Amazing!
-_DJEzZk2pc,guys this movie is gonna be a good movie it will be very dark as a story line but it will be really good
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaqin really wants to win an oscar.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Does anyone know the release date?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Not saying Phoenix won't do one hell of a job in this one, but it's always like when ever there is a new movie with the Joker, most people go crazy and is talking about Oscar winning right away. 
Maybe it has something to do with the role it self. The Joker IS a very interesting figure and without doubt one of the greatest villains ever, so that alone gives a huge amount of credits right from the start.
But it will still be interesting to see how Phoenix will play the character."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can't wait. Not a big comic movie goer but but but i like Joaquin and I know this will be epic
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Well, probably the reason this joker will be the darkest is because he's more realistic."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can't wait
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Easter egg: 1:51

This is the scene where joker talk with 12. year old Batman."

-_DJEzZk2pc,The comment ‚Äúthrow him into society‚Äù which has been copied so much is actually making me not want to see this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Lol really who the fuck is that in real low life to beat up a loser dressed as a clown? Make a movie about that piece of shit instead.

-_DJEzZk2pc,"So we got the flamboyant nicholson joker, the dark gritty ledger joker, the wannabe gangster ledo joker and now bozo the clown joaquin joker. Why are they all so different they are running outra ideas. With that said, joaquins joker looks awesome I am interested for sure."
-_DJEzZk2pc,i have coulrophpbia this makes me uncomfortable but it's still a good trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Whatever the movie is, this trailer is a masterpiece."

-_DJEzZk2pc,10 mil doentes

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Th amount of these comments ""1989: Throw joker into toxic chemicals 2019: Throw joker into society"" on every video and post about this movie is too damn high!
You're not deep."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is that lil Brucy?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The trailer it self is not only about Joker, but the society itself. Now this how you make a trailer.."

-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks SUPER wow!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,when getting released to theaters?
-_DJEzZk2pc,His facial expressions alone will be enough to put entire audiences on edge. We will see the insanity unfold before he finally becomes the Joker. Nobody else would have been good enough to do this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"To show the mental breakdown of a person:
1980s- throw him in toxic chemicals.
2019- Throw him in the society"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is the combination of Venom, it and us"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Okay I know the whole 'they didn't have to throw him into toxic waste, they just threw him in society' thing is kinda cringy. But God when life sucks and you feel completely alien, it can be really hard to find the good in people. But you try of course to change your thinking, try to see the world differently, and it is easy to get discouraged, angry, bitter anyway. The whole failure to launch/mommy issues/ shitty job thing is really relatable to a lot of people with mental health issues, as well as the battle between optimism and anger. I have never watched a Batman or Joker movie, never was particularly interested. But this one looks genuinely interesting to me. The character was so cartoonish before, and idk... Looks interesting!"

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joker actors portrayal :


Cesar Romero : Clown Joker
Mark Hamill : Psycho Joker
Jack Nicholson : Mafia Joker
Heath Ledger : Anarchist Joker
Jared Leto : 'Am I A Joke To You?' Joker
Cameron Monaghan : Start off as ""Spoil Brat Joker""
                                        End with ""Young Nicholson Mafia Joker""
                                        Start Appearance - kinda looks like Mark Hamill Joker
                                        End Appearance - Definitely Heath Ledger Joker
                                        (Still Not Sure which type he belongs to, too many portrayal in his Joker)

continual punches to the gut. If
you're into that sort of thing.
you'll love it. If not... (i am)"

-_DJEzZk2pc,"For me JN, HL, and JP are  the greatest  who portrayed  the iconic villain JOKER!"

-_DJEzZk2pc,Johnny Knoxville has the laugh and Trevor Philips has the attitude to make a Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hollywood is such a disappointment now a days.  Have they seriously run out of ideas for movies.  Seems they just remake movies SEVERAL TIMES.  just like with the new robin hood.

I feel like this movie is a movie CREATED by the Joker to trick people into feeling sympathetic for him.

Brilliant."

-_DJEzZk2pc,"great acting, i am so hyped for this movie. especially to see Phoenix performance"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm Waiting for this  movie Jokerüé≠üòò
-_DJEzZk2pc,"1:08 comedy club named Pogo's. Is that from comics or is it a reference to the real life killer clown, John Wayne Gacy?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this how Honkler was created?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think hes perfect
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where I will found this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,You know I don‚Äôt think they should make this movie because the reason why we like the joker is because he is strange and the reason why it is a great character because we don‚Äôt know what his backstory is . And that‚Äôs why we like the joker like we know his farther was a bad parent by beating up the joker and he fell into a pit of acid and that is what changes him into the joker but there are pokes at his original backstory and making him a pleasant person doesn‚Äôt make the story better it actually makes it suck because in one of the Batman movies he is a criminal and the Batman follows him into a area and the Batman try‚Äôs to save him but he is already in the pot of acid and that is the joker we know and love so making this movie is probably not a good idea especially if they are going to tell us the full backstory for the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hear this movie is going to be rated a hard R.
-_DJEzZk2pc,All it takes...is one bad day!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"They couldn't possibly make DC movies any worse. DC, Hold my beer."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger did it better
-_DJEzZk2pc,Guarantee it flops and is out of theaters in no time terribleeeeee
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why do i feel bad for the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"1:24
He kills them."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm not really seeing what's as good or better about Joaquin than heath, hopefully theres a better trailer soon, it's looking more like a play than a movie"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If people expect to see the joker they are used to they will be disappointed with the character. This is about what made the joker who he is. Turning against society isn‚Äôt the answer, but I put the blame of all the bullies out there. Joaquin has the potential of becoming the best joker and perhaps the jokers fans will feel sorry for him for the first time"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin has the potential to be the best joker ever
-_DJEzZk2pc,HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHA!!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not i lav oLd jhokar
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gave me an orgasm all the time
-_DJEzZk2pc,@ 1:37   in front of the mirror he looks just like Heath's joker!
-_DJEzZk2pc,He  has the coldest  pimp walk turning that corner walking down the hallway Martin Scorsese directed the hell out of this
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is gunna be a heart breaking story as I think this broken mans life isn‚Äôt going well for him as we all can see in the trailer then I think he has had enough and kills what i think to be the dudes on the bus messing with him, then I think he runs off enjoying it then doing it more often, the cases of these murders will go on the news and then his followers will do the same which is what I think the clowns and cops fighting scene is and in the Gotham series on Fox Jerome a character similar to the Joker also has followers, the reasoning is for his laughter as laughter is contagious and in the trailer at 0:55 above the Don‚Äôt Walk there‚Äôs a sign that shows there‚Äôs a street named Jerome so maybe that‚Äôs the reasoning for his followers"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"At 0:55 above the Dont walk sign, there‚Äôs a street named Jerome and for y‚Äôall who don‚Äôt know Jerome is a character in Gotham that I absolutely love who I thought would be the Joker now idk about y‚Äôall but DC might be thinking of making him our next joker which I hooooope"

-_DJEzZk2pc,Grim. Cynical. Dire. Tired. The state of the modern cinema. Phoenix has to be the most overrated actor of all time. He was good in Space Camp tho.
-_DJEzZk2pc,At first I didn't like the look of this. But as I watch it more and more the more I realize its gonna be a fuckin masterpiece. This isn't just crazy laughing murderous joker this is truly mentally disturbed joker

-_DJEzZk2pc,My heart was breaking for his pain and the torment he goes through and that was just the trailer! I will be a hot mess when I actually see the film. He is such a wonderful actor with so much depth.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"He looks like he's gonna be really good, maybe better than heath ledger, but we will have to wait"

-_DJEzZk2pc,This better be his Oscar
-_DJEzZk2pc,Suicied squad jokers better
-_DJEzZk2pc,So many people talking about how he's not like the others or he's as good as Heath Ledger or they should put a different actor in the role of joker. Calm down everyone this movie is a different version of the joker so don't compare him or say someone else should play joker because in the future there will be many more jokers to choose from that your favourite actors could portray
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm surprised that the joker is now the main character of this movie he's like a hero around this part.
-_DJEzZk2pc,What is the song?

-_DJEzZk2pc,"And when all is said and done, we realize thru not sticking up or stopping the horrific bullying and hazing, especially to the mentally challenged, that we have ourselves to blame for the creation of the animal known as The Joker. The world creates this with their prejudices and pride, but mostly hate. Hate begets more hate, until it‚Äôs just too late."

-_DJEzZk2pc,"I like Joaquin Phoenix, but DC really needs to take the Joker out of circulation for a while. When the character gets recast too often, it really looks like they‚Äôre relying too much on one character. I‚Äôd say put Batman out to pasture for a while too as Ben Affleck really didn‚Äôt do any favors either. Sometimes a well planned comeback really works. Just ask the Eagles.  Nobody‚Äôs gonna listen to me though, so I really hope the movie nails it."

-_DJEzZk2pc,Why so serious???
-_DJEzZk2pc,Smile!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Well that looks terrible. That makeup made me laugh. Only 2 jokers have ever given me chills, J Nicholson, H Ledger."
-_DJEzZk2pc,That is going to be a good movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,"But ...ive always thought he was a villain... i dont understand,  but of course im gonna watch bc seems to be a wonderful movie with a great actor...we will see him in the Oscar next year...i realize."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don't know if he can be good as Heath ledger from what I seen from the trailer I'm not impressed the joker getting picked on no way not supposed to be happening looks iffy too me but probably will go see it
-_DJEzZk2pc,This makes me miss heath ledgerüò¢
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC just stepped their game up
-_DJEzZk2pc,"My life was a tragedy...
But now i realize  ....
Its a comedy


The most Meaning partüòîüòîüò™üò™üò™"
-_DJEzZk2pc,i hope all this good comments dont turn into bad comments after watching the movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""Insanity isn't when a person goes mad,it's when someone comes to their senses."" -Unknown"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Honestly,this is a trailer about what society does to a good person,not a D.C. movie"
-_DJEzZk2pc,YOU HEAR THAT BATMAN...PUT ON A SMILEY FACE FOR ONCEü§î
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It‚Äôs hard to beat heath ledger R.I.P to the real joker. I‚Äôm
Still watching this one but without high expectations."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This movie trailer looks incredible...
So did the suicide squad trailer and we all know How that ended up"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I had   no desire to see this, until now. Might be the greatest trailer ever."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I will always love heath ledgers role.
He is king of the jokers."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is it, chief."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can't replace with old joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is how life turns us good ppl crazy?! I love DC villans
-_DJEzZk2pc,The Jimmy Durante song makes it. David Lynch touch.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I want this now. I love the concept and hope we get to dive in the madness in a chaotic and unapologetic fashion. I want to see Joker's smile burning everyone's minds.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hopefully this isnt related to batman. I want it to be like a spin off of it because the joker from batman was a symbol (anyone can be evil) in a way and didnt need a backstory. But i really liked this so idk
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can someone tell me the song?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why so serious
-_DJEzZk2pc,Mmm.... im not so sure about this... this is either gonna be a masterpiece or an epic disaster that will ruin the image of the joker and his legacy as well. Let's hope for the best and in the meantime....SMILE!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath would be proud....
-_DJEzZk2pc,this is my favorite trailer of all time
-_DJEzZk2pc,the first ever dc movie where you can see what's happening
-_DJEzZk2pc,Stupid shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,Of course he's good. He's juat like river Phoenix
-_DJEzZk2pc,"5 months to go.......... ‚è≥ Tik tok, tik tok."
-_DJEzZk2pc,And the oscar goes to...Joaquin Phoenix
-_DJEzZk2pc,"poxa, custa seguir a hist√≥ria original?? Teremos outro fracasso de bilheteria."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"When will DC get passed the Joker and focus on Batman's other villains such as Clayface, the Ventriloquist, Manbat, the clockmaker dude an all those others we never see, I get the fascination and likeable character aspect of Joker but I wanna see how DC can bring other villains in and explain their stories more than Joker every so many years"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Reminds me Chaplin's quote""A day without a smile is an incomplete day/wasted"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Embarrass the TRAGEDY ,
cause we are heading towards ,

-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is actually looks really good,and he makes it look that way."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sticking his dirty adult fingers into a child Bruice Wayne's mouth is the freakest part. Seems like Joaquin is gonna fill Ledger's big ass shoes in his own way. Hope the movie is as good as the trailer.
-_DJEzZk2pc,And the movie got leaked üòÑ https://youtu.be/3pJ4fbeU6Jo

-_DJEzZk2pc,panget mo
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Does anyone else cry when they see this? 
My mom thinks I'm nut-house"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix great actor it will be a great movie i can't wait to watch it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger always comes to my mind
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is the best joker second best is that dark Knight one where he's like ""want to know how I got these scars"" third one is Jack nickelson or how ever you say his last name fourth one is sucide squad one"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"omg i gotta see this, and that's a BIG statement for me considering I've NEVER been a fan of any batman character EVER"
-_DJEzZk2pc,MCU is sending the FBI NOW
-_DJEzZk2pc,The 10k dislikes are stupid people and should commit neck rope.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I thought his was sopposed to go crazy and for batman and harly quinn to be there... What is this???????
-_DJEzZk2pc,At first I thought this movie was about Batman joker......
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin is going to fuckin nail this üëç
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not gonna lie...I‚Äôm kinda confused
-_DJEzZk2pc,I love stories that follow the villain and make you feel bad for them
-_DJEzZk2pc,"algum brasileiro ,"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin deserves this role üëè
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Not sure about the Joker being so pathetic, but i'll watch it anyway, cause Phoenix is gonna crush this!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh no here comes the joker wannabes
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Honestly it doesn't look that good, it'll flop like all the others did after Christian bale... Dc just stop... Superman sucked, aquaman sucked, wonder woman was terrible, justice league is a joke.... Legit just stop DC comics plz....."

-_DJEzZk2pc,no one can replace health ledger....
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This isn‚Äôt just another movie to add to the lore of DCEU. This is a movie showing mental health awareness. And how society‚Äôs stigma about a mentally ill person can destroy that persons life. 

Don‚Äôt believe me? October is Mental Health Awareness month. The Joker releases on October 3rd."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Am I the only one who wants this movie to turn out shit just to make everyone feel pissed even though I think it will be amazing
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Evacuate the cinema, engage all the popcorn, and get this man an Oscar."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker and birds of prey will be the reason i keep breathing for the next couple months.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"A message, you all need to wake up. Heath Ledger died for the truth, Phoenix is doing the same. 

August 11th, 2019 (Acts 7:6-7, H.R. 1242)
God is coming for His Kingdom and may he have mercy on the unknowing but deceived ones. They are making noise and it will only get worse. Prepare, find peace in your hearts and act when needed, till then, remain at peace.

We are all Israel. (God‚Äôs people) The only truth that matters is in God, the Commandments, and the Laws in which he told us to live by. Do not be concerned of worldly things. God told us these things. It is a simple truth. The worldly truths may only spread fear, and God does not want us to fear worldly things, it is like a virus for those being told these worldly truths that don‚Äôt believe in God. We are the ‚ÄúAgent Smith‚Äôs‚Äù of this world. They are then consumed by maybe fear, or ignorance and steered away even further from the real truth that isn‚Äôt worldly by introducing them to this hell of truths in this world. It may only damn their souls. God hurts in these moments. Love and peace to you all. Remember, the only truth that should matter is in God. Spread Love, not hell. Their downfall will come. They are only making noise but it will only get worse. Prepare. God bless you all and remain at peace. Do not be an asset in dividing humanity. They are making America the world‚Äôs enemy. Look into ‚ÄúThe Protocols of the Wise Men of Zion‚Äù, all the truth is in it, all their intentions. Seek the knowledge then turn away from feeding them your energy once you have the truth that you need. This is the foolish work of Knight Templars > Freemasons > Zionists. Their rude awakening is near. God is coming, seek Him and repent. They want a civil war and will stop at nothing at making us angry and reacting with violence. PEACE IS THE ANSWER. DO NOT FALL FOR THEIR TRAPS AND ATTEMPTS AT DESTROYING US."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is How society creates the perfect ever criminal mind
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin is so fucking underrated. That ends now.
-_DJEzZk2pc,‚ÄúSmilee though your heart is Aching smile even though it‚Äôs breaking‚Äù what a great song for the trailer very fitting
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Really cant wait this joker,"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I wish jared letto
-_DJEzZk2pc,Genial!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie will make heath ledger proud
-_DJEzZk2pc,"You know, Jim Carrey could‚Äôve been a good joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I. Cannot. Fn. Wait. Until. October.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like trash
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC was smart to make this movie after all the marvel hype. My gosh what a trailer.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally DC seems like it's going the right way
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Man he does the laugh good

1:09
1:27"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Um just a thought but what if In This world Bruce who as we know is the little boy who joker makes smile goes to be Batman because Joker kills his parents and that is what joker is planning during the stakeout
-_DJEzZk2pc,FINNALY A MOVIE WHERE THE ACTOR UNDERSTAND THE JOKER NOT JUST TO SHAMELESS RIP OFFS OF PAST JOKERS
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""No clue"" person: Life is beautiful, society is fine
Joker: Am i a joke to you"
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:07 they laugh gave some chills
-_DJEzZk2pc,The Joker is the reflection of the evil of Gotham and Batman is the reflection of the good ppl that are tired of the evil in Gotham and the the penguin is the reflection of the crime inside Gotham and two face embodies the way that ppl are two faced and that u can be an average joe one day and a criminal the next.The joker smiles to hide the pain and he has that permanent smile to show that Gotham is full of pain but the ppl refuse to see it and that the Wayne‚Äôs are powerful it refuse to help Gotham and he‚Äôs a direct opponent to Bruce because he‚Äôs trying to make him pay for the sins of his family‚Äôs passiveness to help the weak but he has respect for Batman because he is doing what his family didn‚Äôt do but it was to late and again he is paying for his family‚Äôs passiveness. I can‚Äôt wait to see it I love  movies like this that shows the bad side of society and I always hope these types of movies help ppl self reflect on themselves
-_DJEzZk2pc,I still believe Heath Ledger the best Joker role played
-_DJEzZk2pc,All it takes is one bad day
-_DJEzZk2pc,üëå
-_DJEzZk2pc,The writing is on the wall! They call evil good and good evil!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"my heart felt so full about this, this is how u should make a trailer for such a good movie people"
-_DJEzZk2pc,SOmebody please block youtube on my devices. I can't stop watching this trailer...
-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôve never been so hyped after a trailer.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I seriously feel bad about his past
-_DJEzZk2pc,Damn we do live in a society
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can‚Äôt wait!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joanqin is incredible
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Personally, just on this trailer, I feel like I can watch Joaquin Phoenix‚Äôs version of the Joker and not compare it to Heath Ledger‚Äôs version of the Joker purely because one shows the making of the Joker and the other shows the Joker in full psychotic mode. 

Hopefully the whole film is as good as the trailer!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why am i crying üò≠
-_DJEzZk2pc,Totally not looking forward to seeing this movie I am a complete Batman fan and this just looks completely retarded because the Joker is not supposed to have an origin story and I really wish they would stop trying to give him one that's what makes him so awesome is that you don't know anything about his past why can't they just leave it alone this movie looks retarded
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Need help! 

Is this an origin story or is this an alternative Joker...?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Naja....
-_DJEzZk2pc,He's comeback As a Joker. He's Best Actor again.
-_DJEzZk2pc,You just stole the trailer from dc
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath ledger Joker makeup please
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If I remember correctly he's always wanted to do a joker movie, he just felt the character was overplayed and portrayed so many ways it would be ""another typical joker"" so he waited and they wanted him (DC) for a few years now, he just kept waiting till he felt as he stated ""the time was right"" and how that he has done it..I can tell its gonna be amazing. But more than that, a sad dark tale on how the joker became the joker. I love Joaquin Phoenix ever since I walk the line, method acting at its finest so I know he will take this role seriously. Also look at the weight reduction to have that ""sickly"" effect"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Probably the 100th time I've seen this trailer. It's like Joaquin Phoenix is not acting As The Joker. He is The Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I wanted the hot joker !!! üò≠ nooooo I hated this
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Someone else spotted this, not me, but I'd thought I'd ask, but there is a spray painted question mark on the wall right over the head of the  man struggling in the bed in the elevator scene. Could this be an indication that it is the Riddler in the bed?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I don't know what to say, uh cringe?."
-_DJEzZk2pc,after Heath Ledger is Jared leto  the best joker ever
-_DJEzZk2pc,Â∞è‰∏ëË¥ºÂ∏Ö

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin Phoenix is a TRUE ACTOR and SUCCESSOR of Legendary Heath Ledger
Jared Leto was Satanist Scumbag"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wish Heath could of been here to do this....
-_DJEzZk2pc,I worry this movie will be boring
-_DJEzZk2pc,The trailer is no joke. Can't wait for this movie ‚ù§‚ù§
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this in any way associated with batman
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie is going to make me feel so many different emotions at the same time
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Just like MALEFICENT!
Now is JOKER‚Äôs side of the story..
Next would be???? 
Can anyone guess?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hit like if you miss Heath Ledger

Me: ok :)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The first laugh, that was the laugh bro"
-_DJEzZk2pc,But.....this...ughhhhhhh can they not stick to one fucking origin story????  I swear between this movie and those dumbasses casting Pattinson as Batman.......Just what the fuck Hollywood?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ill give it a shot best case scenario I enjoyed my time
Worse case scenario I get to make fun of it later, Ill let time call this one."
-_DJEzZk2pc,JARED LETO ????
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joachim Phoenix may do what Heath Ledger did.....make The Joker human.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joachim Phoenix may do what Heath Ledger did.....make The Joker human.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don't know. It could work. It couldn't. Time will tell.
-_DJEzZk2pc,There won't ever be an Joker actor like Heath Ledger

-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôm getting a taxi driver/ king of comedy kind of vibe.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Im..

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joker was always villain, Ledger delivered a villain who outperformed thr hero, which leads to bring a joker hero."
-_DJEzZk2pc,ngl i came here ready to bitch and moan about the millionth hollywood remake. I guess i shouldnt have underestimated Mr. Phoenix's talent. I'll be waiting for the release :)

-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix is decent at playing Joker but Heath Ledger in my opinion is still the best at it.The way he made us understand  insanity was just class A acting
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is gonna make me love him so much more
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I already love this movie , looks awesome he is going to win a Oscar for sure"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Am I the only person thats still obsessed with Charlie Chaplin movies and recognized the theme in the background I just got nostalgic about how it would play when Charlie would have a crush on a girl in his movies
-_DJEzZk2pc,"After seeing this trailer I really can't decide which the best villain is. Either Joker, Thanos or Vader."
-_DJEzZk2pc,He's no Heath
-_DJEzZk2pc,that was fucking epic.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Damn.

-_DJEzZk2pc,Going to be F*cking Awesome!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Let‚Äôs not get too excited people. It‚Äôs a DC film. After watching this numerous times I see potential for disappointment.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yes yes yes
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hope it‚Äôs as good as this trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,What a pile of crap. Plain and simple. All the portrayals of the Joker ( my fav super hero. Yes hero I said for Joker is only a villian to those pansy good guys. ) this one is by far the worst. I would have been happy for the joker in Gotham to play the role not whack job phoenix.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This whole comment section is
 r/iam14andthisisdeep"
-_DJEzZk2pc,A man becomes joker because of meaningless bullying or that he is a looser? I hate when they hide their lack of writing with clitches
-_DJEzZk2pc,this joker is trash the one in suicide squad is way better
-_DJEzZk2pc,"One question though, Why so serious?!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Hes gon killlll this role..
I betcha it's Oscar worthy...joaquin don't eff around with roles like this.."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why do I get the feeling that in this movie..Joker will be the one that murders Bruce's parents in that alleyway..
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I've seen so many movies during my life that I've lost track of them. Because of it I acquired a quality-detection of a movie based solely on the trailer alone. Given this I bet my left not/or 100 dollars that this movie will be Oscar worthy. At least for 3 things: acting, directing and music."
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:51 Batman spotted!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"To the 9.9K thumbs down: You‚Äôre the reason for Batwoman.

-_DJEzZk2pc,What earth is Joaquin Phoenix joker?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I love Joaquin Phoenix but no one will ever beat Heath Ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,Extremely promising trailer. Here's to hoping it delivers
-_DJEzZk2pc,‚ÄúThe worst thing about having a mental illness is that people expect you to behave as if you don‚Äôt.‚Äù
-_DJEzZk2pc,This trailer would be perfect if they would have started it off with the song ‚ÄúGotham city 1986‚Äù by Christopher drake from ‚Äúthe dark knight returns‚Äù movie...if you have never heard it then you seriously need to listen to that composed soundtrack it‚Äôs truly brilliant and Gotham city 1986 would be so perfect for this trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,He so nailed the laugh...hope he does it for the rest of the character
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Bitch, I'm so ready!!!! I have a feeling this going to be as good as  Heath Ledger playing the Joker...."
-_DJEzZk2pc,So far trailer looks amazing hope dc knocks it out the park like with aquaman
-_DJEzZk2pc,Allright
-_DJEzZk2pc,Worthy! üëèüëèüëèüëè
-_DJEzZk2pc,OMG!
-_DJEzZk2pc,so like are they going to link his story with the new batman? or? what...............
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The words, ""Joker has an affect on people."" is true and it's deep. Low key, this trailer made me cry. The ending, ""If you just smile"", the song and him, has an affect on me. Definitely seeing this the first day it comes out."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Yes, yes, yes!!!! Joaquin as The Joker...he will awe us with his talent..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Suicide squad was better
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin is on heroin again
-_DJEzZk2pc,lol this trailer came out on my birthday
-_DJEzZk2pc,You can feel how depressed he is
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ummm yes, please, and thank you!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"To be honest I haven‚Äôt seen this much love since our beloved Heath Ledger. This trailer makes the movie seem like Joaquin Phoenix really wanted to do this role and special considerations do care was taken to make this movie a true Joker movie. I really miss Heath, but Joaquin is going to help his memory live on."
-_DJEzZk2pc,seems like the most fking boring thing i have ever watched
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is the Joker we need in the DC Universe, i know this is a side story and isn't part of the overall DCU but DC needs to get back to being more serious and grounded like the Nolan Batman Trilogy. Aquaman can be its own thing that's not part of it as it brings in the big money and keep Zack Synder away from this as he hasn't got a clue how to do subtle. Build the DCU back up with this origin story and then a decent solo Batman film. Harley Quinn next after meeting this version of the Joker. Keep the really powerful heroes / villains out until you've built a good base. DC need to stop rushing as they end up with messes like Suicide Squad and the Justice League."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Mr. Joaquin!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I keep coming back for the trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I thought my life was a tragedy, but then i realized, it was a tragedy."
-_DJEzZk2pc,#NativeSon
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yayyy dc all day
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Everything in this trailer, especially Joaquin, is f*cking PERFECT. The Oscar will be totally deserved."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks pure shite.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôve never waited for a DC movie cuz they‚Äôre almost too comic for movies but this THIS is a gReat movie and I‚Äôll gladly wait for it
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If the movie will be even
 little as good as the trailer.....It will get an Oscar for sure"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"i am so fucking pumped for this...
joaquin is 1 of the most versatile, phenomenal actors of our generation...hell, of all time.
also, we deserve a do-over after that epic shit-show rep from leto/suicide squad."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie looks like poop lol
-_DJEzZk2pc,Batwomen trailer vs this lmao
-_DJEzZk2pc,this movie better be F*ckn good  ijs
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow another masterpiece.cant wait too see it.

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Nicholson: Looks crazy
Ledger: Acts crazy
Phoenix: Thinks crazy"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I agree that they should get Oscar for trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Is it just me or I expected bank robbing, killing, intensity... not a sad movie"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Welp..I‚Äôm back again. Can‚Äôt stop watching this trailer!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,When is Harley coming
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not gonna lie im a little disappointed that i didn't see harly Quinn ‚òπ
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I can't figure out if Joaquin Phoenix is not right in the head, just a plain weirdo, or genius actor."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This so movie is basically trying to do a MCU, first joker, then another, and another."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I cannot get over how amazing this looks, it‚Äôs a completely different yet exciting direction with the character!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,What's the song?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Make Joker üÉè great again!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I want to see this sooo bad...but I won't, because Robert Dinero's in it. He should have kept his effing mouth shut."
-_DJEzZk2pc,let's hope he don't kill himself
-_DJEzZk2pc,0:58 me when the alarm rings at 6: 00 a. m. on a Monday to go to class
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This trailer just showed how people could relate to the infamous villain and become sympathetic to him.. Joaquin Phoenix showed us the another face of Joker,--the light before the darkness, behind the already dark presentation of himself coming from his saddest history.. I'm so excited to watch this!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,i want to cryyüò≠‚ù§Ô∏è
-_DJEzZk2pc,Really what about the movie that they were making of Harley Quinn and the Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,*This honestly looks like a good movie ! Release Date?*
-_DJEzZk2pc,NO ONE CAN PLAY THE JOKER BETTER THEN ‚ÄúHeath Ledger‚Äù RIPüå∏üå∏
-_DJEzZk2pc,Holy fuck this trailer got me to swear
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joker then: thrown in to chemical waste turns maniac
Joker now: thrown into society"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I liked joker from the beginnig of time, but now i know why"
-_DJEzZk2pc,No. I was singing on that song and he started to sing on it too.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôve got a feeling that Phoenix is going to make Ledger look like Leto.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can‚Äôt wait! ü§ó
-_DJEzZk2pc,I've seen this trailer a hundred times before and I'm still looking at it. Is it just me or is it getting crazier out there?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wtf can they ever stick 2 the original comic story! Wow copying some what the VENOM story! Joker killed batman parents ok was a kilker and a thug at a young age hell have him kill robin punk azz lol fin....üòÇüí•üéâüéà

-_DJEzZk2pc,I just felt the present world where one's feelings is not valued but criticised
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think imma pass on this after a closer look
-_DJEzZk2pc,This ain‚Äôt gone be hittin on shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,"All i want to say to my peep, does anyone of u ever thought about dicaprio doing the joker part?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It‚Äôs going to be a flop, they need to make a more appealing trailer."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"DAMN,they dove deep into his character, wow, can't wait to watch thisüíñ"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This just might be the best movie ever made.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gary Oldman would of played a great joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The little boy he puts a smile on is Bruce Wayne. 



Interesting."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Perfect!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I aint goin lie. I was expecting some bad ass bank robbery shit.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"GARBAGE INTERPRETATION OF THE JOKER STUPID MOVIEAND HORRIBLE PLOT LINE THE MOVIE.MAKES NO SENSE TO ANY VERSION OF THE JOKER WE ALREADY WITNESS BY HEATH LEDGER'S PERFORMANCE THIS IS ANOTHER MARK ON THE JOKER NOT A GOOD PERFORMANCE BY J,PHOENIX EITHER  ! 2 THUMBS DOWN"

-_DJEzZk2pc,Who else is expecting Batman after the joker movie .
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:09 ‚Äî my life right now.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is it young Bruce Wayne at 1:51 ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,So we know who's winning the best actor Oscar this year
-_DJEzZk2pc,what ever but no one are joker in front of The Great Legend #Heath Ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,Jeez i got goosebumbs
-_DJEzZk2pc,yep 12 seconds i see Joaquin Phoenix pause comment that ill never watch this movie and leave.....bye fuck you dc. this is why your movies are shit.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don't care want anyone says Jack was the best joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,My god...Joaquin Phoenix will do this role justice.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I use to root for Batman.. But now I realized.. I relate more to Joker... (laugh)
-_DJEzZk2pc,"When he came walking around the corner in the end with full makeup and costume, DAMN!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôll go and see this when it first comes out. This will be the greatest DC movie I‚Äôve seen in a while. I hope DC doesn‚Äôt disappoint . It looks like a very well, put together movie. Just like how Austin powers said ‚ÄúIM SO EXCITED!!!!!!‚Äù"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I was wishing that someone would make a movie about joker from batman. I got my wish granted but I was also wishing that it'd starred James Franco as joker. üôÅ
-_DJEzZk2pc,This has me all ficked up
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Would be cool if Joaquin Phoenix would cut his face and carve a smile on his face in front of a mirror inside a dark room, laughing and crying at the end  of this movie. I would pay fucking mad cash just to watch that kind of scene."
-_DJEzZk2pc,The new season of Atlanta looks great
-_DJEzZk2pc,Down fall of man.  And I love it
-_DJEzZk2pc,this will be the end of gotham
-_DJEzZk2pc,joker was pushed into an acid that's why not natural smile
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel like the joker embodies what the evilness of society can do to the person
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Do any of you think if there was a person that was ALWAYS NICE to the joker and always had his back (especially before he went batshit crazy) that after the joker being how he is, would be nice to him/her?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why so SeRiOuS?.... Gonna be an awesome movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,How tf didn't ik this was out
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think DC may have something here...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Speechless!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit....."
-_DJEzZk2pc,The joker died with Ledger.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie describes my mindset right now
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Sooooo... what exactly is the purpose of this movie anyway? To turn The Joker from a genocidal madman to some kind of wounded, misunderstood hero who only wants the best for us in his own twisted way? üòí

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin never disappoints....he,s amazing"
-_DJEzZk2pc,The joker should win always in ever fight he is the most relatable villian he got sick of society and went awall.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think his performance tops Heath's. Joaquin had to portray the Joker with and without the face paint.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks Damn amazing
-_DJEzZk2pc,This shit gave me chills!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"That's not the joker, that just looks like the joker..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Say it ... With a smile ...i've danced with the devil in the pale moons light ...
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's about time.  Joaquin as the Joker has been a long time coming.  Remember him sticking his tongue out in 'Gladiator' and his ability to take on a dark mind in 'You were never really Here'?  I hope he is nominated for something based on this trailer.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Haha what a total loser
-_DJEzZk2pc,I just want to give him a hug
-_DJEzZk2pc,He seems way better than Jared Leto !

-_DJEzZk2pc,I don't want this actor to fall into depression..
-_DJEzZk2pc,I just hope it's Jared Leto who's playing joker that's all. Other than that DC sucks
-_DJEzZk2pc,The trailer looks good but the makeup of joker is meh in my opinion :/
-_DJEzZk2pc,No one more perfect to play this role! Love it!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Just waiting for the LEGO game version
-_DJEzZk2pc,"i always knew he would surpass heath ledger, no disrespect. but all of you were haters now i see 0 hate comments"

-_DJEzZk2pc,"When this movie comes out I'm going to dress my best to see it, heels and all"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"stupid dont even fallow the real joker storyline real stroyline is Detective Comics #168 (February 1951), nearly a decade after the character's debut. Here, the character is a laboratory worker who becomes the Red Hood (a masked criminal) to steal a million dollars from his employer and retire. He falls into a vat of chemical waste when his heist is thwarted by Batman, emerging with bleached white skin, red lips, green hair and a permanent grin"
-_DJEzZk2pc,There is no Joker backstory! I wish they wouldn't have done that. Sure it needed to be made but at what cost to the mystery that is Joker!
-_DJEzZk2pc,i‚Äôve been waiting for this for forever
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Is this a prequel before Man of Steel, or is this a different story?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wack ass movie worse person to play joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Goosebumbs
-_DJEzZk2pc,I miss Heath Ledger. He would have been perfect for the role.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Damm, story of my life."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Im glad you turned down marvels multiple roles Mr Phoenix, and worked on The Joker with DC instead."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Its about fukng time!!...they shldve also have made a Riddler movie when Jim Carrey was young...he could still pull it off tho...curious to see how Joaquin stacks up w Jack and Heath

-_DJEzZk2pc,this might look scary but its actually pretty sad.....reveals theres something deeper going on inside somones mind....üòêüíî
-_DJEzZk2pc,He deserves an Oscar .
-_DJEzZk2pc,Awesome trailer can‚Äôt wait for the movie to come out. It looks as though Heath Ledger never died because he is picking up right where he left off in Dark Knight. I hope this version will transform into a great franchise in the DC Universe.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Look horrible from this trailer!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'M EVEN MORE HYPE FOR THIS MOVIE AFTER WATCHING ""WALK THE LINE"" MOVIE HE DID GREAT I KNOW THIS JOKER WILL BE CLOSE ENOUGH IF NOT TIE UP DARK KNIGHT JOKER"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can anyone say this is possibly the greatest trailer in the history of cinema?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm sorry the trailer does nothing for me the actor either he's already weird we need some one who can ACT insane not a stretch at all

They are, after all, the institution that gave Rami Malek the statue for essentially doing an impression of Freddie Mercury, but didn't even fucking nominate Ethan Hawke for his brilliant, nuanced and chilling performance in First Reformed. That still infuriates me. They also named that Hallmark Channel piece of geriatric dogshit, Green Book, the best picture of the year, rather than the narratively brilliant BlacKKKlansmen or the emotionally devastating A Star Is Born.

-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôm actually really excited for this to come out!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow. This movie will be stupid! Trailer says it all! Be prepared for a 3 hour movie with next to no action in it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why don't they just make the Killing Joke. Clearly that's where this plotline comes from

Idk hopefully I'll be proven wrong. Glad he's in a major motion pictures. Joaquin's been a fav of mine since Clay Pigeons.

All I saw was another weak ass human getting broken down by our world. LIFE ISN'T EASY, GET OVER IT.  YOU WANT EASY, GO BUY A COLORING BOOK.  
Just more justification for actual people to allow themselves to become less then they really are.  Struggle makes you stronger bitches"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can't wait fr October any more....I love joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,I am really ready for this masterpiece
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC really needs this
-_DJEzZk2pc,"i dont know about this, but hey wot was they like when they said ben effleck was ganna be batman xxx"
-_DJEzZk2pc,We really needed Heath Ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,Who got goosebumps watching this?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think Joaquin messed up taking this role cause I don't see anyone pulling off better Joker than Heath Ledger did. In this trailer him didn't get the same psychopath scary joker like Ledger did
-_DJEzZk2pc,Crap.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Bodo amat
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is that Phil Dunphy?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I cannot stop watching this over and over again
-_DJEzZk2pc,"People are consuming this Joker thing for decades, aren t you bored already?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not a DC movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Lame...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Only Jim Carrey is the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,best villain ever
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Love Joaquin ,,, this looks dark !!!!! I‚Äôm kjnda scared lol"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Really? You guys all think this looks great, just from the trailer? I personally think it looks kinda silly. Joaquin Phoenix seems kinda old to be the joker, no? Like I don‚Äôt believe that Joker would be a challenge to Batman  at all. Not saying they‚Äôll ever be in a movie together, but I just don‚Äôt buy it. It just feels like he‚Äôs trying really hard to bring a serious feel to the joker, to the point it feels like I‚Äôm not even watching a movie about the joker. I duno, maybe this is actually THE PERFECT Joker movie and the majority prefer a joker origin story like this. Guess we‚Äôll wait and see :)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Darn' now this is worth to watch...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Idk man?!?!I'm feeling it
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ledger!  Was amazing! leto sucked ass... the director should have been shot. In the back of the studio. For putting that performance in film! Phoenix looks very promising. Won‚Äôt know until after I see the finished product.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Had no idea he could be this creepy...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow.. this blew me away...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Awesome perform Phoenix deserts an Oscar definitely the trailer is just amaizing!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sometimes beautiful
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:48 jaja que puto
-_DJEzZk2pc,Movie looked like ass ledger  did better can clearly tell

-_DJEzZk2pc,"""We stopped searching for monsters underneath our beds when we realized that they were inside our heads."""
-_DJEzZk2pc,Jus when I thought if Joaquin cud fit in Heath's shoe. Trailer said it all ..
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Oh jeez, just as he was getting back to normal, Joaquin Phoenix is gonna go bat crazy again after this."
-_DJEzZk2pc,He is such a bad acter  that wacthing any of his  movies i swear i lose a brain cell in every word   i hear come ou of this mouth soon  i will most likely have none left
-_DJEzZk2pc,????why?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Movie should be named ,""Whatta Joke!""
Fukk this trash !"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Me emocionei :""("
-_DJEzZk2pc,Trash...next
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie looks like complete shit!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is something else. It's moving cause it's not like a crazy guy with a gun (Nicholson), nor it is the psycopath with spasms of sanity (Ledger). This is just your average Joe, the sloppy, cheap looking cashier guy you took for granted, having his sweet revenge."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oscar.
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:09 Rumpelstiltskin
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It is a good start but it is what is known as an introduction movie ....this movie will be slow but it should and it can be developed intense ...for example , if they get a flawless art director to go good and dark on special effects ...i would give old Joaquin a good amount of sickening nightmare power but you all shy to tbe PG13 world for sales and i understand that ..but in comparison to every adult saying HOLY FUCK. And avengers will slump off going SHIT...it can be done easy and then work slow into the legion of doom so forth , the art direction looks great for the slow intro 123 movie type , Joaquin is has the right look to play an extra sinister joker , but i am top at this shit and i have never got to one coast or tbe other i can smoke anyone doing umbrella projects like a new mutants movie you already fucked that one up too just like X-men and dark phoenix Jessica is awesome but only a nimrod wouldn't cast her as phoenix .....so it will be interesting to see if you got any balls as comic movie ghouls...or if you busted all yohr nuts getting pussy ...now you have no balls for art ...it happens , can't blame men for spending their energy on hanging with women .....while they can"
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's about time batmans arch nemesis gets a movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is so sad...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ledger is still the best one. Period.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I rarely comment on Youtube... But this is amazing !

-_DJEzZk2pc,October 4th is way too long to wait for this movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Don't forget that Phoenix is a huge vegan and the ultimate soyboy so don't expect any support or justification for the alt-right in this. He's gonna play this guy as the ultimate loser.
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's offical: he's an incel and this whole performances is aimed at the alt-right.

-_DJEzZk2pc,"So joker isn't bad, he just got pushed beyond his mental limit and then Batman being seen as a hero even though he did violence. Joker decided to do the same thing but instead, he made friends to get  the poor and oppressed people over the rich and powerful."

-_DJEzZk2pc,Get the popcorn ready I'm on my way
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is not the joker movie that I want to see. No art piece. Make a comic book movie. Marvel is killing it. You are letting people down.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Now get Robert Downey Jr to play Batman.  He's the ideal Billionaire Playboy actor, knows Wing Chun Kung Fu, made Marvel a success at the box office and with Joaquin Phoenix as Joker they can save the DCEU."

-_DJEzZk2pc,Lotta brain damage on this one.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I cant stop watching this...
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm thinking a mixture of head trauma and society is what makes joker joker in this

-_DJEzZk2pc,It's produced by Martin Scorcese. And staring Joaquin Phoenix. How could it not be good? Seriously STFU comic book nerds. With the whole complaint about the joker shouldn't have a background story. Wtf are you talking about? He has several. In this one he's a failed comic. It's going to be great. And I can't wait! Oscar for Phoenix maybe?

-_DJEzZk2pc,We hide ourself in society....but sometimes we have to be who we are meant to be.........A FUCKING AMAZING
-_DJEzZk2pc,Controversial or not this guy deserves an oscar cause i personally think he's been robbed a few times.....You can just tell by the trailer that Phoenix will get an oscar for this role.....Bass an actor on his acting abilities not his off screen life.
-_DJEzZk2pc,only dark night  batman.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The emotions that Joaquin Phoenix portrays through his look, expressions, and voice are captivating, addicting."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I saw it already He becomes crazier and crazier as time goes and by the end of the movie he meets the dark night and is to be continued the end

-_DJEzZk2pc,Dude I miss Ledger üíî
-_DJEzZk2pc,why do i have the urge to cry when I see this trailer and I realize its because I still miss Heath. Its uncanny how much Joaquin captures the Heath incarnation of the joker without trying.

-_DJEzZk2pc,I Like JokerüíÄ
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is like story about joker

-_DJEzZk2pc,That walk @ 2:10 was remarkable
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like he will make a better Joker than the massively over rated Heath Ledger.

-_DJEzZk2pc,"As long as in the end we have no sympathy for the Joker. Remember the Joker is the most insane, evil, cruel, sadistic, unrepentant, unredeamable dangerous comic villain of all time only Ramsay Bolton rivals him."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Come OCTOBER Come
-_DJEzZk2pc,I've got a bad feeling about this

-_DJEzZk2pc,This joker is the father of heath and in the future the heath joker will take on the joker life

-_DJEzZk2pc,"two things of this trailer 
1) this Joker reminds me of the Dark Knight of Chris Nolan (in that movie Joker is played magnifically by Heath Ledger) and this makes me thinks that it could be a prequel of that movie (even if i know it is not) 
2) the soundtrack of this movie is Smile. The cover of the song of MJ Smile, search on YT for this song"

-_DJEzZk2pc,It's not the same without Heath
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Now DC will show to Marvel how to make a good movie ,
 not that piece of shit called Avengers 4 !!!!!!!!!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I can‚Äôt express how excited I am for this movie. 
I‚Äôve always been a supreme Batman fan, and it‚Äôs very rare to find enjoyable content that‚Äôs even remotely related towards Batman.
The only movie I could find enjoyable that‚Äôs related towards Batman is The Dark Knight Trilogy, which will always be common gold, and appreciated by individuals. 
But, this movie has potential, you can already tell, it may not become as popular and cherished as The Dark Knight Trilogy, But I may be right, but I may be wrong. 
I‚Äôm just grateful that they didn‚Äôt inspire the joker into a ‚Äú gangster ‚Äú like they did with Jared Leto, and instead you can tell that he actually had a origin, and a reasoning for his actions, even with a simple trailer. 
Anyways, I‚Äôm sure you get my motive, I just can‚Äôt wait."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Idk why, but the scene at 2:20 always gives me a sort of Bioshock feeling... And I love it"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Honestly, after Jared Leto, it wouldn't take much to impress me when it comes to a new Joker. But damn.... this trailer tho! Legit af!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks like a steaming pile of shit,to me"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Mata todo es lo m√°ximo
-_DJEzZk2pc,The trailer did a good job making me feel bad for Arthur. But I hope I start to  hate him when he's Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC¬¥s dark style like in dark knight is exactly what i wanna see.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Jared Leto 100% better joker

-_DJEzZk2pc,Let's face it nobody can replace ledgers joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm sorry, but I just don't wanna see this...to me, the Joker is better simply as a nihilist without a backstory, someone that simply has no morals. Heith Ledger (may he rest in peace) will always be the best Joker by far."
-_DJEzZk2pc,buuuuuuuuuuuuuubuuuuuuuuu
-_DJEzZk2pc,Prediction: This movie will flop!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This trailer hit me in the pit of my stomach,very well done.The joker is a character not a lot of actors can pull off.This is gritty and its real.This movie has dirt underneath its fingernails and i like it."
-_DJEzZk2pc,When i think about joker and how scary visually he is compared too batman.... in cinema this image of joker will be a good antagonist against the dark knight

-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm honestly stoked about this movie.. seems like we get a more depth into the joker and a feel for the character... Heath ledger's joker was still the best.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ladies, gentlemen, This is how you make a trailer."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I liked Jared Leto
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm surprised they have not made joker into a woman yet. It's only a matter of time. Batman will be remade and all the characters will be gay or trans women.
-_DJEzZk2pc,If your one of all the ones who's waiting for the Joker to be released please watch my diaries from the inside^^ https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLid_HmFYVZjtMNpeEpqaS-LYzRJzOuJx2

-_DJEzZk2pc,R.I.P. Heath Ledger there will never be one better üôèüèæüò¢
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker - The villain that Gotham doesn't need. But one it certainly Deserves.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why do I feel like he‚Äôs gonna nail this role?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"what we need is more gritty realistic ultra violent/noir superhero type movies.
The christian bale bat mans are easily the best of the last 20 years.
fuck super powers, fuck chemical accidents, fuck nuclear mutations."
-_DJEzZk2pc,All it takes is a single moment that can make one lose their sanity in the right situation...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where he laughs in the comedy club his life reminds me of the old Cesar Romero Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,I was waiting for the iconic laugh. But that can wait.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Either im gonna love it so much or hate it so much, there is no in between"
-_DJEzZk2pc,What a fucking piece of shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gamers rise up
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I just noticed that he writes with his left hand early on, but he carried the bag with his right hand while running.

Probably looking into it too much, but when the movie comes out keep an eye on his handedness because they might sneak in a left/right hand change to show when he's finally lost the plot."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger is the best joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Time to oppress the oppresser. Gamers, rise the FUCK UP!"

-_DJEzZk2pc,This makes me really sad. But actually bc Joaquin Phoenix reminds his brother River...
-_DJEzZk2pc,2:16 is best moment in this movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The staircase represent his sanity
-_DJEzZk2pc,Maybe DC can redeem its self with this. Because justice league was just awful.. Along with suicide sqaud
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:15 that creepy as heck üò£
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Might be a good movie but coming from probably the biggest Joker fan ever,t his looks like garbage.No permanent white skin,his names apparently Arthur,living with his mom and basically an old man.Its like they know nothing of the real Joker and based the entire concept on being the polar opposite of Jared Leto's Joker which I actually enjoyed"

-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks terrible.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is the first superhero/super villain trailer that makes me sad.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Such a tragic character played by a wonderfully expressive actor. :57 the point when he should be having fun on a date he forces such a telling glimpse of his inner pain.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"No doubt about Phoenix performance, he is one of my favorite actor, but is only one Joker for me .. Heath Ledger"

-_DJEzZk2pc,More like penguin i guess ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wish his suit was purple instead of a violet plum mix
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The signs the clown mask wearers in the trailer are waving look like Occupy Wall Street type messages, protesting inequality.  They would be right at home with Bane's supporters from TDKR.  I'm curious to see if this Joker is the inspiration/leader of that movement, or just a guy who's taking advantage of the strife to commit crimes (as happens in many cases of protests in real life)."
-_DJEzZk2pc,The little boy that the joker is making smile is bruce wayne
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is the worst trailer

Well now we are going from short hair leto joker to long hair tragic joaquin phoenix joker"

-_DJEzZk2pc,Is he going to say it?!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"There's SOOOOO much subtlety from.phoenix to show how this man is desperately trying to hold it together then just snaps 

So many shots where his body language is sunken into himself tense clenched fists head down, a single tear, forced laughing through what looks like severe pain then after adopting the joker persona total looseness confidence and abandon

I can't WAIT for this"

-_DJEzZk2pc,When becoming a super villain somehow feels like an inspiring story.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Great we ruined another back story.....now Jokers origin is about someone being bullied and then turning evil. Why cant we just leave GOOD stories alone?!!?  WTF!

-_DJEzZk2pc,Bruce childhood looks like georgie
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The only thing that this Joker may lack is the sadistic intensity in the eyes.  Don't get me wrong, the acting & portrayal is superb.  I'm just hoping that there is a transition in his eyes ... a transformation ... from sad to pure evil in his eyes ... one where his eyes are wide open, the upper eye lids barely show, & the lower eye lids are slightly raised ... ALL THAT with a huge maniacal smile.  I hope to see this in the movie toward the end."

Joaquin Phoenix looks like he really got in the role, and is mixing both the methods of Heath Ledger and Jack Nicholson. Looking forward to it, I don't care if you think I am a DC Fanboy either like thats a bad thing. DC 4 Life"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This Joker>Jokers. Except Heath's.

We live in a society"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is how I really see joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,looks kinda boring. Also looks like he doesn't become the villainess joker until the end.
-_DJEzZk2pc,this joker has the potential to be better than Heath Ledger's
-_DJEzZk2pc,i cant wait for this ..
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm stoned, so shoot me a nickel.
It would be very, very cool to re-arrange the Year One Batman into this Joker version. Story wise."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I am an old man, and I can honestly say, this is the best trailer I've seen in my life."
-_DJEzZk2pc,TV deserves a better class of criminal.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Its a gay clown  story?
-_DJEzZk2pc,beautiful trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,This has a real Brian DePalma feel to it.

-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel bad for him yet he is even better as the coolest villain

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Up until now, I always believed that The Joker is more interesting without an origin story in that it remains a mystery.  However, this movie might be the acceptable origin story I didn't know I wanted.

I just hope his eyes would transition from calm to maniacally intense (aka eyes wide open and you can't see the upper eye lip but the bottom eye lid is slightly raised) all while smiling."

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin Phoenix is an amazing actor probably one of the best actors in history of acting, he should have won an Oscar for his portrayal of Johnny Cash, Heath Ledger in my eyes as of right now is the best Joker and I think I truly think that Joaquin Phoenix will be the best Joker in the history of all the Joker's combined, if people cannot see the true genius of Joaquin Phoenix they need to open their eyes, because in every movie that Joaquin Phoenix brings you he brings you something special each time, he makes you think, he makes you laugh, and also he makes you cry, I can't wait until October 4th to see the new true amazing brilliant work does Joaquin Phoenix making history as the Joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,what a beautiful masterpiece
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Oh shit that trailer just gave me goosebumps....my heart cried happy and sad tears just from the trailer....can't wait to watch this, Joker has always been my number 1 fave villain ‚ù§ü§°"

-_DJEzZk2pc,1:50 Is that supposed to  be  Bruce Wayne?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"No, no, no this is not how he becomes joker not like this. At least make it where he fell into toxic waste or mental issues. Not because his life was ass. No no no. I don't want to see him fed up with life and turn psycho. Don't change the story line. And the joker started off in his mid 20 not in his mid 30 or 40."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Bruhhhh I've watched this video like 50 times and it's so sick each time üò©
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Feels like it's going to be dull, with not as much action"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is so bad acting
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is going to be unbearably sad.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix sends himself into the actor Olymp...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is it just me or the world is getting more crazier
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix is the Joker I have been waiting for.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin‚Äôs Joker will rival Health Ledger‚Äôs joker (Opinion).
-_DJEzZk2pc,I liked the makeup on the Heath ledger joker more
-_DJEzZk2pc,I love heath ledgers joker for how crazy and dark and insane he is. This joker goes to another aspect of having the more comic appearance but still the crazy and insane personality that makes joker joker. Both actors portray joker brilliantly.
-_DJEzZk2pc,not since jack nicholson bet it will be awesome
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Just out of interest, like if you have watched this trailer more than three times."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I kinda hope it ends with him cutting his smile and laughing hysterically but I doubt they're going that route cause they want to be different than Heath lol..
-_DJEzZk2pc,"When joker comes out in the  suit I get goosebumps,
I rewind still get goosebumps."
-_DJEzZk2pc,That final shot of him looks fucking incredible....
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I can‚Äôt stop watching this, I‚Äôm so excited"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This trailer made me sad
-_DJEzZk2pc,Poor Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hey that looks good
-_DJEzZk2pc,It would look decent if he just looked more like classic joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks great
-_DJEzZk2pc,It looks interesting but .... it's not the actual Origin of the Joker like in the comic books
-_DJEzZk2pc,It just goes to show you society can make a good or nice person Dangerous.
-_DJEzZk2pc,That laugh GAVE ME CHILLS the true laugh of pure happiness
-_DJEzZk2pc,Honestly cant wait to see it
-_DJEzZk2pc,"And who is the hero ? Batman, superman ..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I like Jared leto more
-_DJEzZk2pc,arthur fleck? Seriously! What happened to joker‚Äôs original name Jack Napier
-_DJEzZk2pc,IT'S A SHIT
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""Smile, though your heart is aching. Smile, even though it's breaking. When there are clouds in the sky, you'll get by..."" This is a very unhealthy song. You suppress your anger and sadness, you'll go apeshit. No wonder the Joker went crazy."

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Thomas Wayne Thinks People Who Wear Masks r Coward, What About His Son Bruce ü¶á"

what the fuck is it with all these cancer super hero movies... fucks sake"
-_DJEzZk2pc,still not heath ledger level but still 100times better than jared leto
-_DJEzZk2pc,"1:51 wait, i-is that Bruce?!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's beautiful ü§≠üò≤ but tbh nobody  could beat Heath ledgers joker RIP Heath but Phoenix does look good we'll see I'm excited though
-_DJEzZk2pc,looks like trash
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where does he get those wonderful toys!?!?!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fuck endgame
-_DJEzZk2pc,Giving the Joker a backstory seems wrong to me... and he just seems like a disturbed child to me. Not the clown prince of crime. Just doesn't fit my taste when it comes to the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I can‚Äôt lie, this looks good!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please get him in a new batman film with bale.
-_DJEzZk2pc,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYrAOaiMWIo&t=28s new trailer joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin phoenix is the best for joker's character... He is the best..love yaa
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I really hope this is a good movie, DC finally realizing that they are not Marvel will produce gems like I hope this would be"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"After Heath's more serious rendition of Joker it'll be nice to see another Joker from the opposite end of the spectrum, one about laughter and flashy insanity"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"i really hope this movie isn't butchered in the editing room like justice league, since they came up with alot of the scenes as the movie was being filmed"
-_DJEzZk2pc,He laughs like mark hamel's  joker and I can't wait to see this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks boring tbh
-_DJEzZk2pc,"When i was just a baby my mama told me ""son always be a good boy don't ever play with guns"" but i shot a man in reno just to watch him die when i hear that whistle blowin' i hang my head and cry"

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Pretty good, but not as good as the joker from the dark knight"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"What's next? Penguin comes from Antarctica?  Which i wish they make a movie of the penguin now, why stop. It looks like the Dark Knight, which is 2nd best behind Michael Keatons, Jack Nicholson, and Danny Devito version; which is my favorite.  Sorry peeps that was my introduction to the Bat, Joker, and The Penguin."
-_DJEzZk2pc,After infinity War even though they acquired the X-Men don't be surprised if DC Movies get good during the 20s...

-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow the best trailer I‚Äôve ever seen. Joaquin what a great take on the joker. Bruce Wayne and the Joker are similar - very dark and twisted driven by madness. Bravo üëè
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please.... Everyone knows Charles Mingus wrote the history of the The Clown (also known as the Joker)
-_DJEzZk2pc,Walks up the stairs Arthur fleck..and comes down as the joker.. great foreshadowing in the trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,Phil Dumfy just went phsyco!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Welp...I'm hard
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ledger's performance is hard to beat, but if Phoenix can tie into the development he created then I will be very pleased."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I honestly can‚Äôt wait
-_DJEzZk2pc,I kind of like the natural joker look instead of a disfigured face. Maybe his face will become fucked up later?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can‚Äôt be the only one who got a little teary eyed right?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks great.
-_DJEzZk2pc,When Joaqu√≠n Phoenix deserves the Oscar since the Trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath was better. Facts.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I know that too well 1.15
-_DJEzZk2pc,The film ends with the opening scene of the dark knight by nolan
-_DJEzZk2pc,Let's put a smile on that face!
-_DJEzZk2pc,The real Joker personification was just waiting for Joaquin Phoenix.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks interesting
-_DJEzZk2pc,Art

-_DJEzZk2pc,"i fucking hate saying this, i never thought i‚Äôd say this, it‚Äôs killing me to say it and i‚Äôm kicking myself in the leg saying it, but if anyone can live up to the joker role after heath ledger‚Äôs amazing performance or maybe even perform it better, it is DEFINITELY this guy! i can not wait for this!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks boring tbh
-_DJEzZk2pc,Kampret ini Filem gua tunggu3 banget
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""People expect you to behave, as if you DON'T? !!! üòÅ"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Anyone else sick and tired of all these actors trying to be famouse again by playing the joker enough with the joker stuff unless you bring in a new joker that will be the. Joker for like the next couple years people can connect with and pull for new actors playing the same character will honestly burn people out on the character truthfully
-_DJEzZk2pc,I bet this movie is gonna have the same affect the dark knight had by causing people to turn into wanna be jokers
-_DJEzZk2pc,So uh where‚Äôs Batman üò¨
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I used to be a huge DC fan but until the newest gen of stuff I just dont know. DC is making up for lost time, horribly too, to the Marvel cinematic universe.

-_DJEzZk2pc,I cannot wait until October for this film!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin just needs to keep Joaquin.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Got sort of a ""Taxi Driver"" vibe from this trailer, actually excited to see a DC movie for once."
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:52 this could be Bruce Wayne
-_DJEzZk2pc,so all those gifs we  have been seeing of someone cosplaying joker.... has actually been viral marketing/filming for this movie?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow.. so deep...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The answer to the quiz is 1950s, 1991, They were being prosicuted, 1942, Grocery stores, French"

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Hi guys, they liked my new interpretation of the joker :)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I really wanna see batman vs joker in 2019
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks like the Real deal!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Not sold on the trailer... I'm glad, unlike most, this didn't give away the whole movie in the trailer, but I was at least hoping for a good Joker laugh and not a somewhat half-assed chuckle. Hoping for a better look at what's to come."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Does anyone notice that the lyrics displayed at 2:24 is wrong? It should be ""You just smile""!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"what an actor!!!! thats what acting is, so many bad actors out there thinking they are good. Learn from this guy."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Jared Leto: has left the chat
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not ashamed to say that this nearly moved me to tears; now I'm obsessed with 'Reaction' videos. Masterclass.

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Having tears in my eyes 
üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger would have been even better. But I think the joker needs a bit more strength and it was said that he got his scars from his father?
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks brilliant
-_DJEzZk2pc,Movie kinda looks wack but maybe it will tickel my pickle I love  the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think that kid that the joker put a smile on him is Batman right after his parents died this is going to be good
-_DJEzZk2pc,I want to report this video... It's too addictive.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Kinda be cool if phoenix's joker was like the little brother of the ledger's joker and the movies somewhere gave a back ground story of ledger's joker dying off and then the little brothers joker coming to ""fill his shoes"" kind of script through some random events. Like they couldve been seperated and placed into foster care or some shit but brought back together somehow"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I SMELL THE OSCARS :)))
-_DJEzZk2pc,this is crazy
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix Jack Nicholson and heath ledger are the best actors playing joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel sorry for Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,We live in society
-_DJEzZk2pc,magnifico
-_DJEzZk2pc,Should have used Heath ledger for the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is like some kind of sjw joker rip off of heath ledgers performance. You guys really do struggle to feel any real emotion and relate to anything. Tyler durden said. You have no great war, no great depression. Your war is a spiritual war because your family neglected you growing up making you void of identity and purpose not knowing where your ancestors came from you have no history to take pride in. And so your great depression is your lives"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'll watch it but, the Joker's laugh is off. Very bad laugh!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If the Joker is the Clown Prince of Crime, then who is the King? 

By the way this is an amazing trailer and I'm honestly hooked and very interested in watching this"
-_DJEzZk2pc,chills
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie will be a bust.  D.C. Will ruin yet another classic character. Will ben alfak be in it? Oh I do hope so.....
-_DJEzZk2pc,01:09 that laugh... Crazy
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel like I can relate to the trailer alone!
-_DJEzZk2pc,For me Cameron Riley Monaghan aka Ian Gallagher was the best Joker in Gotham.  Hopefully oaquin Phoenix is as good or better.
-_DJEzZk2pc,GAMERS RISE UP!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Y‚Äôall know he‚Äôs makeup is John Wayne Gacys
-_DJEzZk2pc,This joker can turn batman into a side character in his own movie...

-_DJEzZk2pc,"this was shot 10 mins away from my hometown, and no joker will ever be better than ledger!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I used to think my life was a tragedy, but now I realize it's a comedy...the human life is a comedy, such a true"
-_DJEzZk2pc,bro this trailer was the absolute worst -.- who chose this actor
-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôm thinking 2nd ever comic book Oscar for yet another joker performance.  The character just provides so much scene chewing moments
-_DJEzZk2pc,I like how his makeup looks like gacey. Pointy
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Why wasting the time to make movie about the Joker?, while there is so many others DC Character out there...."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Who else thinks this movie is total bull sh^&?
-_DJEzZk2pc,We thought joker needed batman but batman needs the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,The DC movies we want and deserve
-_DJEzZk2pc,A descent into madness
-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôm hella down with Jaquan Phoenix as joker but I hate the look they have him. ..

-_DJEzZk2pc,O feel DC will finally hit the nails head with this one
-_DJEzZk2pc,i dont know why those people felt the need to steal his sign and hit him with it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,He looks like he is the good guy
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Has nobody noticed the obvious here?... A ‚Äúcomic book‚Äù movie trailer without a SINGLE explosion, gunshot, or overblown special fx shot!

-_DJEzZk2pc,"What I'm kinda confused about (and maybe someone who knows can answer this) is this -¬†

What is the Joker in this? Is he a domestic terrorist? Or an actual super villain like he has always been?¬†It seems like this is a more realistic movie on a random psycho causing mayhem under the moniker of ""Joker"" than it is about the actual DC Joker.¬†

The Joker is a notorious super villain who murders like crazy. Why is it showing him as more of a weak shit starter if the real Joker is an intelligent psycho killer? I mean he's getting punched out on a subway train by a couple businessmen. Forgive me if I don't know about Joker as much as I thought, but I would've thought Joker would be busting skulls on that train."

-_DJEzZk2pc,"If Joaquin Phoenix is such a great actor, how come i can hear his gay lisp in every role he does?  If he were so great, you'd think he could make his voice regular too.  He's not great, he's just another gay jew propped up by hollyweird."

-_DJEzZk2pc,"The Joker character is little bit dangerous for any actor because we saw Heath Ledger and we all know what happened to him, now he reduces his weight that much. I hope nothing would happens to him"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"In my view of the joker, I think it brings out feelings between pity and revulsion. His plight and his mental illness make him an extremely pitiable villain while his actions are so reprehensible that they just can't be forgiven. I've long felt that the movie portrayals of him, as good as some of them where, failed to capture this aspect of the character like this trailer does and I hope it continues in the movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I love this trailer but only downside i have is it explains his origins story how he became the Joker and for me that's what i loved about Joker is it's that you newer knew his true identity, what made him the way he is, him being mysterious is what made him stand out and gave us the opportunity to hear some of his made up stories which were very interesting and fun to listen to but apart from that i am looking forward to seeing this movie"

-_DJEzZk2pc,This Joker kinda gave me Heath Ledger vibes. üòØüòØüòèüòè I'm hoping he would stand up to the role
-_DJEzZk2pc,The scary thing is that Heath Ledger really did some crazy things to prepare for being the Joker. Including living in isolation for 30 days. Joaquin Phoenix seems oddly perfectly suited for the Joker and it's not as if he didn't do the prep work - but this seems more effortless.  Like he's channeling some of himself in the film. I just wanted to point out that he also plays Jesus in an upcoming film.
-_DJEzZk2pc,ü§°ü§° o/
-_DJEzZk2pc,This moving is fitting in many ways. It comes out at a time when mental illness is actually being seriously looked at now and not shunned by society. The Joker seems more realistic in a way because he is portrayed in this case as a normal man slowly being bent into a genius level intellect homicidal killer that rivals Batman constantly in the books.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath ledger is much better
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think they finally got it right and casted a very good replacement for heath ledger I‚Äôm sure Joaquin Phoenix can pull off the joker perfectly

When they used a different style of joker but more of a badass. I can't wait for october."

-_DJEzZk2pc,"0:50  they way she takes her arm down, i think that is showing that she does not have the strength to hold her arm upwards, and going down lower is better for her arms. this shows she has gotten older, and i know this is just a movie, but she is probably wondering why he has not moved out, and is probably regreting having a kid this much of a burden, with someone who will kill her, and mentally damage his son for life"

-_DJEzZk2pc,"There's Lot of subtext in the trailer that i like,
1.The board he holds says ""Everything must go"" which shoows the nihilistic nature of joker
In Hospital lift a patient screaming while joker says silent next to him which subtly shows joker is losing his mind and he is doing the same as patient but within his mind.
Stairs is a metaphor for his life.....In the beginning of trailer he struggles and slowly climb the steps which is like he is struggling with his life.But after he completely turned to joker he dance on those steps which means he doesn't care about his life anymore and he dont believe in all the society said bullshit."

Looks interesting enough but DC us good at fucking things up and honestly the scene where they steal his sign looked stupid, did they mug him or just steal his sign and hit him with it? I'm also less interested in seeing him JUST become a psychopath, I feel like the way they've characterised him in this trailer makes him seem like there's no way he could end up with a mob of loyal criminals underneath him but maybe that'll also be approached in the movie."

-_DJEzZk2pc,"I remember after Edgard Ledger's Joker, I heard many people around the world commited crimes disguised in clowns/joker. Here in Belgium, a young man entered a nursery and killed several babies and nurses, desguised as the Joker. Same for the shooter in the theater showing Batman Dark Knight Rises. 


Don't get me wrong, I love that character but he is so powerful that he somehow awakes that crazyness in suggestible persons. It's just like the Werther effect somehow, the character impregnates some people with their ideas and it becomes real."

Its going to drive me into insanity enough of this shit already the joker from suicide squad looked like a  fucking tweaker from oildale heathe ledger was a good joker but come on I'm tired of this shit pretty soon the rock is going to play the fucking joker or tekashis stupid ass and they will make a big deal about it or machine gun Kelly. Mark my words the joker has no super powers yet no one can kill this weird fuck I'm tired of it. They'll nuke this fucker and he'll still live
-_DJEzZk2pc,You can‚Äôt critique this trailer it‚Äôs not even comparable to what we think it might be.. you would have to watch it and I would bet money that his part in this films his characters emotional state he drew from his real life childhood experiences will fulfill the role. I can‚Äôt imagine how it‚Äôs gona play out because that was just my opinion. If you think about it the only comparison that can be made is the way heath ledger faded away too just for this particular character. There‚Äôs a big difference between a joker and a clown. I do believe you have to repurpose your mind to play an unhinged clown.. heath deliver ed but Joaquin Phoenix will shine within this moderation of a joker

Stop with the dramatic reimagining of our favorite characters. One of the things that makes the Marvel stuff work is that it‚Äôs familiar to the fans! Wolverine is Wolverine, etc., and, when he‚Äôs not, the fans hate it. So far, you guys have managed to make Joker a thug, Superman an unfeeling alien, lex Luthor an OCD nightmare...etc. The only character who was pretty pure was Wonder Woman. You guys hit a massive home run on that one. Oh and Shazam? Wow. But seriously, ANOTHER weird take on Joker. Boo."

-_DJEzZk2pc,why so SEROUS???
-_DJEzZk2pc,That laugh in the background when he gets knocked to the floor on the train is so fucking great!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Before going into this trailer, please make sure that you watch it with a fresh set of eyes. If you try watching it by keeping in mind the Heath Ledger's version or the one in the DC Comics, then you will miss out the nuances of this gem.This whole teaser trailer gives the vibe of the movie Taxi Driver. The small congested apartment, the narrow hallways and the environment around him.Thorough out this teaser trailer, you could see that Arthur laughs to get through his circumstances. He is using laughter as a coping mechanism. The scene where he is in the almost empty train and laughing lifelessly, appears to be a continuation of some misfortune and it seems as if he is trying to get through it by just laughing. Also, the most powerful moment for me in the whole trailer, is the scene where he forces himself to smile even though his eyes are brimming with tears. That scene is so plapable, one could feel his sadness when that single tear drop falls from his right eye. It just breaks my heart everytime I watch this trailer.And who could miss the song that has been so aptly used in this trailer. The one used here is by Nat King Cole (originally sung by Jimmy Durante and written by Charlie Chaplin) perfectly captures the above emotion. If you could read the lyrics, you could see how poignant it is. It gives a life to this trailer and makes one see how Arthur is trying to embody this in his life across all the misfortunes that are happening to him.You could also see how the people around him treat him. When he is smiling and holding the placard in front of some shop and simply doing his job, it is the children who assault him. The Children!!! And in the train, you could see that it is the people in the suit who mistreat him for no apparent reason. One can see that it is the filth (people) around him, who destroy him completely.All in all I can say that it is a heart breaking trailer, which shows us that there are people around us who go through a lot and how the acts of cruelty done intentionally or unintentionally could derail them completely.And remember ‚ÄúAll it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Laughter at 1:26 was heath ledger.
-_DJEzZk2pc,this will be great blockbluster movie of DCEU...where the villains are on the lead roles..believe me someday MArvel will copy this formula of DCEU..but im a both fan of these two great franchise...cant wait to see JOker FIlm....it will be great for sure...congrats DCEU..great job....you are doing great ever since...

Constantly having to redue, and restore everything so we have a dozen completely different stories and images of the same hero or villain. I really don't care if a movie wasn't right or perfect, I just want he story continued, not remade."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So the new joker origin story begins with a man who has a creepy Norman Bates-esk mother fixation. His mother sings him the song ""Put on a happy face"" during his childhood which he now adopts as a mantra. He then gets repeatedly shit on by life until his mantra breaks, he snaps and becomes a maniacal serial killer/criminal.

This is the most cliched garbage I've ever seen."

-_DJEzZk2pc,"i would agree that heath was awesome, but from the looks of this trailer, this joker will sound, laugh, and act more like the joker. Heath was a bit too much on the serious side. He seemed more like a killer with face paint. This guy seems more joker-ish."

-_DJEzZk2pc,just imagine if Heath Ledger was still alive and played this roll

-_DJEzZk2pc,This role is great for Joaquin Phoenix
-_DJEzZk2pc,Still better than the entire Suicide Squad movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Thumbs up if you think heath legder is the best joker of all time
-_DJEzZk2pc,i bet u this movie is gonna win Oscar this year.people fail to become a joker in their real life but if they see someone holding down a great smile on their face all they could do is be jealous of it and try to make him sad within his mind.we all have a joker within us its just we don t have the courage to bring it on and be happy in what we are currently
-_DJEzZk2pc,now imagine heath ladger would still be alive man Holy smoke this movie would be DC¬¥s big hit.

-_DJEzZk2pc,wow this looks very bad
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fucking retarded.
-_DJEzZk2pc,ALMOST like every comic book movie in the last 5 or maybe even 10 years were really really good honestly probably only a small handful out of the 10 thousand that came out haha. But this... looks like it has a bunch of potential!! Ive loved Pheonix in pretty much everything he has been in and long before I ever heard about this movie years ago always thought he would make a killer joker and glad to see it somehow actually came true!! i feel like he may even be a joker that is as good or maybe even better than Heath either way Id be so happy. Im not getting my hopes up though because trailers these days literally make every film look like an instant classic and masterpiece so ill just keep my fingers crossed.
-_DJEzZk2pc,corney and laughable excuse at trying to be better than the last joker that died ... you will never be on his level this is pathetic. LOLOLOLOL I WILL NOT SEE THIS
-_DJEzZk2pc,He's looking  more  like a anti hero in this.  Don't hate on me

-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Pheonix should really be one of the last people to play as the joker. There is more to the joker than just being insane. Not just anyone can play the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Trailer seemed bored
-_DJEzZk2pc,From behind he looks like  Heath Ledger the joker From the dark knight (2:08)
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Any heath ledger fans here?

-_DJEzZk2pc,"It looks like pretentios european garbage. Same old crap: oh, he was so kind and so humble, but cruel society broke him! Boo-freakin-hoo. I hope there would be better reasons for him to go crazy, then primitive bullshit that was shown."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Song is absolutely perfect for this movie...
The part that haunts me is the expression on his face after he pulls his fingers out of his mouth making a smile...."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"More excited for this, than I am for Endgame."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm not sure about this. The Joker has always been a villain with no backstory (he creates a different one each time he talks to the psychiatrists), no name, no alter ego. He's a flat character: a character that doesn't change, but changes the world around him. He's evil, he's chaos, period. That's just who he is. No need for a motivation that makes us feel sympathetic towards him, no need for a reasonable explanation about why he became that.

I know this may sound surprising these days, given that most recent villains are sympathetic (Killmonger and Thanos, to name two) and flat, unsympathetic villains have been a failure (Steppenwolf, Ares, Doomsday), but sometimes they work! And the Joker is a prime example of that. I'm not sure I'm OK with turning him into someone with a name and a reason for being what he is. He works very well not being relatable."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Still prefere Jared Leto.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I really like Joaquin but Crispin Glover is the natural choice for the Joker. The Cure's Robert Smith is second.

-_DJEzZk2pc,Love that trailer! Nearly cried....  :')
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It's amusing how many people are talking about how society has gotten so bad that it creates the Joker. meanwhile, crime is at historic lows, wealth at historic highs, and this trailer showed a man experiencing almost no hardship. Seriously, he voluntarily took a job twirling a sign, a small group of punk kids take the sign and he chases them into an alley for it? That is utter shit writing."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Being a sociopath is the most lonely you can ever get without realizing it.

The trailer makes it look like it'll be one of those that transcends its genre, managing to become a film that really ties in with the zeitgeist of our times, as well as being a film about The Joker :) and I love that it's a 'character study' rather than another dumb Hollywood spectacle. Phoenix turned down working with big movie directors and producers on principle of how they work - really cool to get a sense of this kind of cinema going in a different, more nuanced direction."

Come on October!

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ughh after heath ledger played joker I literally cannot see anyone topping that performance smh so sad that his talent is not here anymore to do this part. I‚Äôll give it Joaquin looks like it might be really though. You can tell he really skimmed down for this role, just curious to see how it plays but I‚Äôll always think about heath in this role"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can anyone explain the trailer to me. Why is the joker bathing his mother?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Never push the happy man too much and he will be the worst thing u could ever imagine
-_DJEzZk2pc,I've watched this 5 times and it just keeps getting better.

-_DJEzZk2pc,what is the music that starts at about 1:29?
-_DJEzZk2pc,The more I watch it the more I like it
-_DJEzZk2pc,Iam a marvel fan but this movie looks good

-_DJEzZk2pc,If only Batman worked during the daytime
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Damn, wasn't expecting to like that. üòÆ"

-_DJEzZk2pc,"I am not sure if we watched the same thing here.  Or youtube is censoring comments.  But from what I have seen here, I have NO desire to see this movie."

-_DJEzZk2pc,this rey be nice
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this a drama movie?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The reason marvel does better than dc,
Because they actually stick with the same actors for characters for more than one film"
-_DJEzZk2pc,nice
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Good movie no doubt about it, but Heath is our one & only Jocker, just saying."
-_DJEzZk2pc,bullshit...but it will sell in the country of origin.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The best actor choice for joker since ever. Joakim nailed it . Awesome acting.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I think this‚Äôll be a good movie, just not necessarily a good Joker movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Deep...
-_DJEzZk2pc,does this mean there will be a batman reboot?

-_DJEzZk2pc,Seemed a bit too deep
-_DJEzZk2pc,"What a blessing...to go mad, & truly not care."
-_DJEzZk2pc,shit stuf
-_DJEzZk2pc,They casted him correctly. The directors knew they needed a hard hitter after Heath. And I think Joaquin will knock it out of the park. Each Joker actor has brought a new facet to the character. Going to be exciting to see what he can do. Jared Leto was the worst. Heath and Caeser Romaro were my favs. And Mark Hamil in the animated world. He was amazing too.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Me: Sorry Endgame, but I don't love you as much. I'm hanging out with a new girl. i cant do this with you anymore. I'm sorry, but its over.
Endgame: Is it Joker? The one everyone hated a couple of months ago? Also her mom gives crap every time she is in public.
Me: She changed, and her mom is now doing well. She made one of her children spoiled tho. He is called Shazam.
Endgame: oh Edwin, you are a disgrace to me!
Me: At least im gonna have a fun time (it was a joke, cause Joker)"

-_DJEzZk2pc,I actually feel bad for the joker. wierd?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"‚ÄúHeard joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Says life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain.
Doctor says, ""Treatment is simple. Great clown Pagliacci is in town tonight. Go and see him. That should pick you up."" 
Man bursts into tears. Says, ""But doctor...I am Pagliacci.‚Äù

-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks dummbbbbb
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This actor is so good, but I think they are taking the character in the wrong direction. I know this movie is focused on the physiological part of the joker witch I agree is the best part about him, but this joker is just ew. He does not seem very intelligent as he writes like a five year old, and sounds like one too. Joker is also a very good hand to hand fighter, this joker looks like he can‚Äôt handle my 8 pound dog. His body looks like a plastic bag full of bones, and he shares an apartment with his mom? Who that old lady. Creepy! I know joker should be fucked up, but it does not have to be this fucked up! This looks very great, but not for the joker, or the way I see joker at least. I think he should be cooler in a sense, not so naive, not as childish, and the outfit ain‚Äôt for me. Ik a lot of people like it, not trying to hate but this joker is not for meüòñ"
-_DJEzZk2pc,song name ???????

-_DJEzZk2pc,I simply can not wait for this one
-_DJEzZk2pc,Remember one of the best Marvel movies to date is Logan rated R
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Based on the looks of this trailer, I'm guessing their holding on to this movie till October for the Oscar race. Suggestion don't, people will come in droves to see this movie opening weekend. People were wondering if Todd Phillips to pull this off based on his track record with the hangover movies. One thing people fail to realize is comedians, comedy writers, comedy directors have some of the most fucked-up warped minds out there.     Please keep the tone going when the movie comes out if it has to be R then let it be R rated."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks fucking awful
-_DJEzZk2pc,Rip Ledger.But he was not the best Joker by far.I was pretty disappointed.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I would of kept the other one but done this dude as his dad and started as his dad
-_DJEzZk2pc,It looks pretty good . But it would of way better with Heath Ledger being the üÉè
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The Joker is an entertainer with a message to a sick society. He makes us look at it for what we really are. The human is just another animal who is able to speak out freely, to express himself clearly. Make no mistake about it, behind what he does is a brain."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally something about Gotham that makes sense..
-_DJEzZk2pc,The more hyped I get for a movie the more disappointment I will feel if this movie doesn‚Äôt live up to the hype. No doubt Jaqauin Phoenix is the actor to succeed expectation by let‚Äôs be real. DCs last entertaining or ‚Äúgood‚Äù movie has been Wonder women. Tamper expectations and just wait to watch.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Smh we live in a society üòî
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looking forward to the movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The movie should deserve the title since it will be the product of mixing great classic movies like ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Raging Bull"". I also believe it will school some Netflix addicts into watching real films"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Damn we really do live in a society
-_DJEzZk2pc,Honk !  Honk !....
-_DJEzZk2pc,I remember the day I watched Joaquin kill his dad in the gladiator damn.. and when he fought aliens in signs with a baseball bat or her when he fell in love with a computer ai lol.. or I‚Äôm still here when he tried to retire acting and be a hip hop artist.. long history of wtf moments led up to his insanity as Joker!

-_DJEzZk2pc,I cannot stop watching this damn trailer. Ugh. So good
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Oh , please. Give me a break...!!! Every fuckin year , there's new joker and it's getting BOOORINGGG."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I think I prefer the ""Killing Joke"" backstory where he's a struggling comic with a wife and child on the way, makes his fall into insanity that much more tragic vs. this ret-conned one where he appears to be a repressed mama's boy with social anxiety and perhaps another unspecified mental disorder."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This gave me chills omg
-_DJEzZk2pc,mutha fuck yesss
-_DJEzZk2pc,I like Phoenix but I'll take Heath Ledger in a heartbeat.
-_DJEzZk2pc,honk
-_DJEzZk2pc,"One of my favorite actors paired with one of my least favorite directors. I hope it's all it can be, but, I'm going to stay cautiously optimistic."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks awful.. No resemblance to the true character at all.. The joker was a violent criminal long before he became joker.. And he was certainly never a clown. This is going to suck worse than the dark knight.

-_DJEzZk2pc,"I hope they don't waste too much time getting him there.  
I want him to become The Joker quick so we can see him DO IT TO IT!  LOL!
I love this Character he is Gotham's biggest nightmare!!"

-_DJEzZk2pc,This is going to be an Oscar Award winning movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,All DC has is the joker and Batman. Getting boring
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Me thinks this movie could set precedence for a fresh direction in the Batman saga. Assuming the Joker doesn't kill Bruce's parents, the story might narrate that they are both pushed by the same impetus: horrendous urban chaos. Maybe they are at odds over methods of cleaning up the streets and punishing evil, one vying for injustice to pay; and the other for the unjust to simply perish."

-_DJEzZk2pc,"I love the evolution of the joker, no matter how you see him, if you put the work in the audience is sure to love it.
Be it the campy old Joker (in adam west batman)
Jack Nicholson's version of the old and the new
Nolan's version of the terrorist and anarchist
or this version of the mental illness driven one.

Suicide squad was shit because:
- most of his scenes were cut
- it was not true to the jokers core personality. he seemed more like a thug (a mob boss) than a joker
- it was extremely overhyped. They banked on the popularity of joker to sell the film. No matter how popular a character is YOU NEED TO PUT IN THE EFFORT TO DEVELOP HIM AND MAKE HIM INTEGRAL PART OF THE STORY WITHOUT SQUEEZING HIM IN EVERYWHERE."

-_DJEzZk2pc,The guy speaking on TV is Thomas Wayne.  I would really like to see the Batman in this universe.  It would be grittier and more realistic than Nolan's version.  I hope they continue this franchise.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Who felt a little sad for Joker?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ok this looks real artistic! Like a movie where we can understand him, and why Joker is The Joker. Like most villain movies he is bad because the hero needs a counterpart. Here you see his full spectrum. I am having high hopes for this one..."

-_DJEzZk2pc,"fuck is joaquin ugly whitout a beard, river was much better"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Apropos, I think, in the current zeitgeist. A cautionary tale. The inevitable consequences of a society driven to madness. The most prosperous, most powerful nation ever to exist...and the joke is on us. Because although we claim to be the ""greatest"", we sit atop the wrong end of the most shameful lists: mental health, violence, incarceration & recidivism, economic inequality, anxiety/stress/depression, suicide, cancer, heart disease, obesity.

The Joker is a perfect symbol for what we're becoming. The human mind is fragile yet adaptable. Easily warped and dangerous when pushed past its limits...and the only option is anomie. Withdrawal from society, from empathy and the recognition of intrinsic human value... and acceptance of cold, sadistic animosity as the only practical defense mechanism. 

This could be brilliant. It seems to say, there are no evil men. Only the application of rational conclusions, based on rational responses to an abusive, degrading, apathetic environment. There is only nature. That is the tragedy/comedy of it all. We learn to abuse each other, as we are perceived as only means to each other's ends. It's a fucking game. What a joke ü§°"

-_DJEzZk2pc,1:09 is the best part
-_DJEzZk2pc,"ummmm, I think this is where DC's strong suit lies, telling the back story of the villians and the superheroes (yes, others do the same, but there's something about DC's edginess that keeps me coming back for more). 

I won't compare Phoenix's Joker to Hedger's Joker, they can stand alone in their own right, but what I will say is this, any award nomination committee woud be insane not to nominate Phoenix for his performance (I know this all premature and film companies are notorious for putting scenes of the movie in a trailer but leaving them out of the main feature). 

Also, the casting of Zazie Beets and Brian Tyree Henry was a pleasant surprise (after catching up on FX's Atlanta, I'm so happy to see the cast of the show finding their place within the entertainment scene, they truly deserve it). 

All in all, a great movie, a definite choice I WILL be watching come October..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,His smile üòä is classic
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It's super fucking creepy that he holds his mouth in a smile with his fingers.  Like he's psychopath trying to be normal, but doesn't understand why normal people smile, what normal people feel when they smile, even doesn't understand the mechanics of smiling.  It literally gave me chills because his eyes were fucking creepy and twisted with pain and/ or anger that became clear when he took his fingers out of his mouth.  Wow.  I look forward to seeing a transformation from ""normal"" to MONSTER, and that's what looks like will be shown in this!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Crap
-_DJEzZk2pc,This ‚Ä¶ this is a terrible disrespect of the Joker character and all the reincarnations before it. Please do not release. Ever.

-_DJEzZk2pc,Toxic society.....
-_DJEzZk2pc,The trailer is more than wow!! Brilliant ever!Man has portrayed the Joker well. Somehow managed to meet the Ledger standard!But unfortunately my heart wept thinking of the Legend-Heath Ledger!!

It's all a joke.
I'm speaking of existence.
Life is death. 
Conciousness is the definition of insanity.
We're all insane in our own little way.
As a society? Just watch the news, stop and observe the world around you in a perspective outside of your comfort zone. If you have the mental capacity to do so of course.
Put yourself in the shoes and look though the eyes of those who you look down upon and judge. Realize the fact that the one you judge could pull out a gun and pop you in the head with lead without warning. Even put poison in your drink while youre not lookin. Or, just even someone's who's heart isn't as corrupted by ignorance or as selfish as yours, who actually cares for others, truly selfless...
Magnify your perspective, open your mind, and you'll see that normality is actually insanity with a rhythm that switches and is interrupted through constant chaos. 
Life, what we call existence is true anarchy. Laughter is the anarchy of the mind, that's why it makes us and our life around us, just feel better.""

Joker is the kinda villain who needs to be allowed to have a film where they can really let loose. Much like how deadpool is that way for marvel. Could you imagine a pg-13 deadpool, it would be terrible. And to be fair aside from Dark Knight trilogy,  DC has yet to put out a decent flick."

-_DJEzZk2pc,Marvel fan boys are not going to get this film...there's not gonna be any lazers or magical stones. Since there were no explosions or ninja moves they are dumbfounded after watching it lol
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks very boring...
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks terrible and boring.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"OMFG yes. Joaquin, shine like you always do and blow us away with the way the Joker is meant to be depicted in this film. I am stoked and cannot wait to see what this turns out to be. No one can say that anyone could ""fill"" the shoes of  Heath Ledger. Seriously no one could. But by far I cannot wait to see Joaquin do this and to see this film. Thank you so much."
-_DJEzZk2pc,What the fuck that looks AMAZING I can‚Äôt wait
-_DJEzZk2pc,Anybody know if they‚Äôre going to put this joker into a Batman movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is dark as shit... and I love it

-_DJEzZk2pc,Like for old joker :'(
-_DJEzZk2pc,Doesn't sound good :'(
-_DJEzZk2pc,Look like a good movie! I‚Äôm a little disappointed that they didn‚Äôt go with the classic joker face paint though.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why not use the killing joke story line?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think LOS Angeles also needs a Joker üÉè
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joket turned evil because society turned on him......Kinda like Anakin Skywalker......RIP Darth V.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Rest in peace Joaquin Phoenix
-_DJEzZk2pc,"No wonder the Joker checked out into a form of psychosis that inflates a false sense of happiness. It was a way to deal with his miserable existence surrounded more by a bunch of horrible heartless people. This makes the joker in the Dark Knight make mounds of sense. ""Some people just want to watch the world burn."" This is what happens when you denigrate and destroy a human beings will to live. People should learn from this movie. Great premise. The only way in which the Joker and Batman differ is that Batman chose to stay in the Dark to uphold justice and the light and to try and improve the society whereas the Joker chose the Light and Happiness to tear down the frail fabric of society, trying to expose them for who they are and let them ""eat eachother."" They are quite literally the inverse of each other. You'll notice that all three villains in the Christopher Nolan Trilogy were actually moral anomalies, trying to save the world from cancerous civilizations and Batman stood in their way because he believed people could be saved. Neither was necessarily wrong, just different perspectives on what they perceived to be the problem of society to be and how correct it. Batman thinks he can use intimidation and fear and prison to correct peoples behavior, The joker believed everyone is part of the jungle and thought it was funny how ""animals"" pretend to live in society, the league of shadows predominately oversaw the existence of civilizations to keep in check governments that can become corrupt."
-_DJEzZk2pc,this suxx
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hes a great actor but shouldnt be the joker. It doesn't fit.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dammm his expressions look so realistic.  But then again. I always felt his acting was very real.  My personal favorite (GLADIATOR)
-_DJEzZk2pc,"With the little boy there, I would think that it's intended to be Bruce, which will make the joker 60-70 when he would battle him, sounds scary.... I don't like the look of anything in this trailer, there is only one joker for me, RIP Heath. I do think that Ryan Reynolds would make a decent Joker.. Maybe he's actually more suited as the Riddler now that  think about it"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm looking forward to this movie. A stand alone Joker with a new twist is exciting!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks like this takes place in the late 1970s, maybe early 80s. My guess is only based on the cars seen throughout the trailer. Definitely going to check this out."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"1:26, that cackle is perfect"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Rip Heath Ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,This shit trash

-_DJEzZk2pc,"It's chilling to see this new Joker and I absolutely love it. My father used to sing Smile by NKC when I was feeling glum, but somehow I just can't help but feel like it's a hell of a twisted but fitting Song when intertwined with this Joker.

I've got a good feeling for this."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Arise New Joker!

-_DJEzZk2pc,"I‚Äôm sorry but I think Jim Carrey would make the best Joker, the reason I think so is because Jim Carrey is a man of a million faces and can have a creepy laugh can act a serious roll and can also be funny."

-_DJEzZk2pc,""" If you just smile!"".   I wanna scream!!!!!! Gotham will never be the same!"

-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm so excited cause the Joker always have been my favorite character from DC Universe and I was worried about the actor. Sorry but I didn't like Leto as the Joker and I didn't want a second chance with him as the Joker. 
I like Joaquin and I have high expectations for his characterization."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This looks really good
And I don't like movies

-_DJEzZk2pc,Truth is... the game was HONKED from the start.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The new it movie is less scary than i thinl
-_DJEzZk2pc,First reaction- Wack......by the end-Im feeling it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,So the movies called not heath ledger pretty much
-_DJEzZk2pc,When Ronald McDonald is tired of your shit.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Did the joker served in the military? Did he have an abusive parent? Did his sense of humor change into a sadistic? These questions should be answered in this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sure the police officer on the TV is the same actor as the Congressman in The Dark Knight Rises
-_DJEzZk2pc,Aw yiss DC is gonna get good
-_DJEzZk2pc,And Russell crowe as batman? Are  you not entertained??
-_DJEzZk2pc,mein erster eindruck ist nicht wirklich gut! ich denke das ich diesen Film nicht im Kino anschaue da er mich warscheinlich entt√§uschen wird! im Gotham der serie ist die entwicklung des Pinguins super. die entstehung des Jokers finde ich schlecht!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Man I cannot wait to see this!!! Fucking fantastic actor. One of my favorites. I can already tell he‚Äôs done the character justice.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Brilliant. This is a parody about today‚Äôs society
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's really looking like Joker might be the hero Gotham needs in this one. I have a feeling it's gonna be a tear-jerker.

-_DJEzZk2pc,I'll mad that when stan lee died dc started to make better movies
-_DJEzZk2pc,I believe they chose the perfect actor for the role. I love Jared Letto but didn't like his role as The Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Irony is society needs ""Batman"" but it will always create  ""Joker""  ."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I have this theory. This joker is much older than Bruce Wayne right? What if Pheonix character is not the Joker, but an inspiration for a child, say that single mother character‚Äôs child in the movie? He becomes the Joker! What do you guys think?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,No red hood ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,If this is canon than Gotham‚Äôs version (TV show on Netflix) of Joker‚Äôs origin story is BS?

-_DJEzZk2pc,I like this trailer because it is not a costume play show.
-_DJEzZk2pc,That laugh beautiful
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don‚Äôt know (said with a skeptical tone)
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wack af

-_DJEzZk2pc,His laugh is really creepy!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is it me or did I see Teddy from black ink crew in there???
-_DJEzZk2pc,Johnny cash wildin
-_DJEzZk2pc,And just before this Warner/DC/Fox made a whole series that suggests Joker's origins at least in a more intriguing way if not so true to the original comics. I consider Cameron Monaghan's interpretation to be the most plausible pre-Joker so far. Good luck topping that.

-_DJEzZk2pc,I say better than Jared and Heath
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wait what this doesnt seems right because joker was a psycho all his life he did not became one and hes dad cut his mouth into a smile. All I can see is someone who wears a mask and is a bit wierd. This isnt the Joker sorry.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Trash
-_DJEzZk2pc,"beautiful, spectacular, wonderful THE JOKER"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I‚Äôm supreme psyched. My favorite villain finally gets his own movie. I iust wish Heath Ledger was here to fulfill this role, I enjoyed his Joker the most. Don‚Äôt get me wrong Jack Nicholson did his thing. I just loved Heath‚Äôs Joker more. I don‚Äôt like this Joker‚Äôs makeup, but I have a feeling I will leave the theaters satisfied. I‚Äôm ready for October to come."
-_DJEzZk2pc,The story of joker really sad
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I dont know if anyone can beat Ledger, but Pheonix is doing an amazing job. I actually want to see a DC movie. Jared Leto was joker???...where??...he was a joke... not the joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,now i have to wait for october
-_DJEzZk2pc,They should have used Nat King Cole's version of smile.
-_DJEzZk2pc,joker rules. batman drools

-_DJEzZk2pc,"This looks awesome! Can't wait... Too bad there's going to be annoying people trying to compare to Ledgers and Leto's joker, in which you shouldn't. It's just a different adaptation. No ties what so ever..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hmmm...the jury is still out based on this preview.  I was totally feeling Jared Leto but maybe Joaquin Phoenix will surprise me.
-_DJEzZk2pc,great.... another movie to bring the freaks to life.... gone are the days of great films. üòî
-_DJEzZk2pc,at 1:08 - doesn't seem like it's the original voice of Joaquin.. Still sounds really promising
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think Jim Carrey could be perfect joker too.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"When you've seen Heath Ledger's Joker character, anyone trying to enrol it looks so fake!
I've never seen any actors acting as good as Heath Ledger in his Joker's role"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Here for opening night! <-- line start's
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope this movie leads into The Batman. I hope it teases the Batman standalone film.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is gonna be fucking garbage, no thanks."
-_DJEzZk2pc,the guy really did not deserve that with the shield
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Yup, this look like good drama .. but omg this is not Joker XD"

-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks good but no one will be better than heath ledger!! üêêüôèüèª
-_DJEzZk2pc,"its a shame that this movie has the potential to be an all time great but because it won't make a billion dollars at the box office all the marvel fanboys and critics will look at it as another DC ""failure"". These are the movies that will withstand the test of time. Im sorry no one is watching iron man 2  ten years down the road"
-_DJEzZk2pc,MA NICCA HEATH LEDGER WHERE YOU AT?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope Mr.Phoenix has understood the darkside of method acting in roles such as this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Awful, no thanks"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ok the scene on the stairs is pretty amazing
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I dont want to feel sorry for the Joker and observe his close relationship with his mom, watch him get beat up.  I want to see the Joker being mischievous since a young age - creating his own, psychotic principles which he operates by"

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Repent! The kingdom of heaven is at hand! In the beginning the LORD God, our heavenly Father, breathed into us life and blessed us with His laws, that we may be His precious and holy people! But we have disobeyed the LORD and brought sin into the world! Because we have sinned, mankind has been cursed with death! Our holy Father hates sin and He will punish all who have sinned against Him! Since the beginning we have been rebellious to the LORD and followed our own evil lusts. Humanity became more and more evil, refusing to obey the LORD and walk in His righteousness! All of humanity have sinned against Him and deserve to die! No one is good or righteous! No one can justify themselves! Every person on earth deserved to die and to suffer eternal damnation! 

But the LORD God had mercy on us all! Though we are sinners and stubborn at heart, the our heavenly Father provided forgiveness and salvation! God loved us so much that He sent His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to die for our sins! Jesus Christ was the only man without sin; for this reason He was worthy to take away our sins with His own blood! The Lord Jesus Christ suffered shame, was beaten, spat upon, brutally tortured, bleeding all over, and died on the cross! But He was resurrected three days later! He is alive right now, and God has given Him power and dominion over all things! Jesus Christ gave up His own life to save us from the wrath of God, and the blood He shed for us cleanses away all sin from us! Because of Him we can be forgiven of our sinful ways and be reconciled back to God! Jesus Christ holds the gift of eternal life, and He shall grant it to all who believe in Him and repent of their sins! 

Repent, believe and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and bare good fruit of the Holy Spirit! Repent of fornication, idolatry, adultery, homosexuality, transgenderism, masturbation, pornography, murder, wrath, strife, stealing, drunkenness, lying, witchcraft, yoga, sorcery, drug abuse, sedition, extortion, envy, arrogance, heresies, revellings, revilings, weed smoking, cussing, lasciviousness, hatred, emulations, variance, and unbelief! God revealed His mercy to us through His only Son, and we can break free from these abominations through the blood and Spirit of Jesus Christ! 

But those who reject the mercy of God and remain in their sins shall be denied everlasting life! The sinner shall die in his sins and be thrown into hell! They shall weep bitterly and gnash with their teeth in unbearable pain! The Lord Jesus Christ will pull them out of hell to face His judgement, and he shall be condemned! The sinner shall be cast into the lake of fire and suffer the second death! 

Only those who are born again can escape eternal damnation! Those who have believed in Jesus Christ, repented of their sins and have been baptized in His name shall be saved! On the day of judgement Jesus Christ will grant them eternal life in the kingdom of God, and there they shall rest in eternal paradise! But you must be born again to receive this gift! No religion will save you! Catholicism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, any religion will lead you to hellfire! Only the true word of God can save you from condemnation, and the second death! Jesus Christ is the only way to be saved; repent, believe and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and be saved! Jesus Christ is returning soon to judge this evil world and only those who are born again and endure to the end shall be saved!"

-_DJEzZk2pc,"First super hero/villan movie in 10 years that actually looks good. Marvel is a lost cause, but theres still hope for DC."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I don't care what people say, this looks ace and really looking forward to it. Phoenix was the right choice to replace Ledger"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I also play League of Legends, so I know what he's going through."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Big Izz copied his comment wich got 13K likes from the original trailer video
-_DJEzZk2pc,No one will be mark or even heath i hope the movie is good. Because im not a fan looks lame.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dc is always dark and drama filled. Where's the action! I'm not about this movie lol
-_DJEzZk2pc,Could have chose a better actor
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Heath Ledger is finally resting in peace... Thank God, Jared Leto is behind us now."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Yes! Something I can look forward to, and a DC movie no less! Those two don't often go hand in hand these days. Aquaman was okay, but this looks like it can really be art, and something worth watching."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why am I strangely attracted to Joker now?
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is the first time in years a trailer has actually made me want to watch the movie. Looks interesting.

-_DJEzZk2pc,This is üí©
-_DJEzZk2pc,BOOOORING!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I have a good feeling this movie is going to be total shit. After the way they made heath play the joker, there is a really hard niche to fill in for him to be up to those standards of total crazy and this movie just looks like it's going to be mostly boring."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If DC started their universe on nolan's batman, they are bigger than mcu now..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dang he lost some weight for that role
-_DJEzZk2pc,"As a non batman fan or comic/super hero fan in general, this is interesting. I think it might be one of those films that transcends the boundaries of genre enough to get the same breadth of audience as the dark knight trilogy did. I thoroughly enjoyed those films because they were just really damn good films. This is giving me similar vibes. Fingers crossed anyway, its tough not being a superhero fan these days, basically the only AAA movies being made in the action scene these days!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Meh...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Did you see Thanos at 1:10?  Wow!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is it christefer Nolan direction ?

Because we value ourselves rather than plastic idols."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker in 2019. Driven crazy by *LIBERALS!*
-_DJEzZk2pc,That's not Joaquin Phoenix. That's some guy pretending to be Joaquin Phoenix pretending to be the joker

I've got to admit - that laugh suits the Joker as a character so well."

-_DJEzZk2pc,So that means I have to wait for 6 months?
-_DJEzZk2pc,It looks fantastic and creepy! I can't wait! Why October?!

-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow Heath Ledger must‚Äôve made a big impact on the joker character. The joker legacy still continues on

-_DJEzZk2pc,Brain says: Phil Dunphy. Whole movie ruined.

-_DJEzZk2pc,"n'ah. I'll give that a miss to be honest.  
Looks like it wants us to feel sorry for him.  That he's just had a rough time of it.  
Like a down trodden man on the edge who just snaps, rather than the evil, criminally insane psychopath that he's meant to be."

Mr. J is a complete & other sociopath who has no feelings for anybody but himself - and pretty much always has been. The backstory he deserves is that of a gang punk who likes torturing things smaller than him...

It‚Äôs not that that man‚Äôs adversaries all have to be unsympathetic Dash Catwoman isn‚Äôt, Penguin can be a villain with a tragic backstory, and Two-Face is the perfect example of a good person driven mad by his disfigurement and thus to villainy.

-_DJEzZk2pc,for god sake! stop chopping onions!!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hopefully this movie with garner the Oscar for him. He is so deserving - his work is amazing!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"after Heath Leadger..
no one can be real joker but him
he was THE joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Truth. : Tragedy can create something .  criminal , punisher or protector .. Its feel really sad living in this suck society .. I mostly feel sad after watch this .. Because my society that I live is suck too ."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This really shows what a Society can do to a man.
-_DJEzZk2pc,No Smilax?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Don't like it. Looks whack.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"An Origin Joker movie? Sold.
In retrospect, he just looks like a happy guy that Gotham drove madü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This makes me feel bad for the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC need to stop make movies and focus on animated cartoons. They're better than there movies by far
-_DJEzZk2pc,Jimmy Carr as Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,0ooooooooooo
-_DJEzZk2pc,"We live in a society. Gamers, we must rise up against women and minorities"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Did anyone else think this was about Joker (from Persona 5) being released in Smash?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm glad the DC is bumping the brakes.  Marvel took it's time.  So many movies before The Avengers.  DC rushed it's universe.  Wonder Woman has been the only standout amid hatefulness since Nolan's trilogy wrapped.  This is how you do it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The villain with no haters
-_DJEzZk2pc,meh
-_DJEzZk2pc,I used to think that my life was a tragedy...But now I realize...It's a comedy.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This doesn't look great. So glad he's the joker though. Lets see what happens
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why does it remind me of Mera Naam joker!?
-_DJEzZk2pc,that was underwhelming
-_DJEzZk2pc,My God drama from DC! I waited
-_DJEzZk2pc,It would have looked much better if his nose wouldn't be red
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Somewhere in heaven, I think Heath Ledger is holding Joaquin Phoenix's beer."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"chic trailer, I hope the movie will be even better"
-_DJEzZk2pc,wow
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Can't wait, eeeeck."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where‚Äôs the murder
-_DJEzZk2pc,It‚Äôs charlie chaplin modern Times theme in the background
-_DJEzZk2pc,No idea how many times I've watched this trailer.  Joaquin Phoenix is perfect!  So excited for October...
-_DJEzZk2pc,A movie souly about the birth of the joker... YES! fuck yes! I need this in my life now!! :-D
-_DJEzZk2pc,Interesting ...üòé
-_DJEzZk2pc,That's not the joker... You people are fucking stupid fuck what normal people want! What about what us comic book nerds want? This movie is a swift kick to the nuts for any comic book nerd and it's an insult to the character.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please no black Batman please.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not the Joker we need but the one we deserve.
-_DJEzZk2pc,They‚Äôve copied John Wayne Gacys makeup
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is gonna be a tear jerker. Better stock up on kleenex. Can't wait!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is an insult the the joker... It doesn't look like they did their home work on the Joker at all and he doesn't even look like the joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,looks like a story about a sad clown that turns evil ? he is the thing gotham needs !
-_DJEzZk2pc,WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY. THIS POST WAS MADE BY GANGWEED ON YT (youtube)
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is the guy who hoaxed having a mental illness for many months in 2010 just to promote his film project with Casey Affleck. I remember seeing him on letterman and he could barely keep a straight face let alone convince anyone it wasn't ""in character for a movie"". I assumed he retired and lost the narcissistic addiction hollywood is known for. Having watched the trailer this seems like a repeat of the same story we have all see over and over."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Trailers from Dc bring me back and the movies push me out
-_DJEzZk2pc,Honestly would have been 10x better without the marvel / DC bullshit
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I feel really bad for the joker üòûüòû
He's Soo heartbroken üíî"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"In a world (bad pun, I know), where movie trailers suffer from nausea-inducing editing, eardrum-ripping audio, and are rife with loads of spoilers, along comes this. The Joker has restored my faith in the true art of trailer making. Well done.
(Edit: Joaquin Phoenix is going to be incredible.)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dc joker movies need a enima. Top notch wp.
-_DJEzZk2pc,2020 ~ Best Actor..and the Oscar goes to..
-_DJEzZk2pc,not another one...
-_DJEzZk2pc,This reminded me on how bad our society really is
-_DJEzZk2pc,I came back 2:15-2:17 so i can see him with the invisible sling shot stomping on the stairs
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Surprisingly mature audience in the comments, refreshing."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is gonna be dc's best movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,"oh god, what a shit -.-"
-_DJEzZk2pc,i definitely cant wait for this. i wanna see his characterization and the psychology behind it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It looks like he actually starved him self for the role and he seems super into it, like second nature... I have the feeling were in for another legendary take on the joker ala heath ledger but fuck I hope it doesnt ruin his life."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So according to Hollywood, everyone white dude in public will assault you for no reason."
-_DJEzZk2pc,why all the hate against Jared Leto??
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Clever, Twisted, Psychotic, Theatrical, Dark, Humorous, now this puts a smile on my face."
-_DJEzZk2pc,So much better than Jared Leto.
-_DJEzZk2pc,They made an amazing decision with the soundtrack
-_DJEzZk2pc,he doesn't seem as crazy as the real joker should be
-_DJEzZk2pc,*society made this joker*
-_DJEzZk2pc,"You honestly couldn‚Äôt have found anyone better to play Joker. Bravo DC, Bravo."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Poor guy, all he wanted to do was to give joy to the world."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like GARBAGE
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Sorry to disappoint all the DC fans here but not really what they're expecting from this movie. Big bomber ahead! This starting to look a lot like some high brow Indie low budget movie meant for Oscar statuettes very much so like Birdman. Its gonna be off the charts in terms of artistic value, Freudian psychoanalytic introspection and yes  acclaimed performances, even a Phoenix nomination for sure and an Oscar who knows but for the common popcorn movie goers gonna be a huge letdown action lackluster and frankly boring as hell. Sorry to burst your DC bubble but that's what this movie is shaping up to be. October release date????? Probably selected theaters as well....do the math guys. The writing's on the wall!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,–•–æ—Ä–æ—à.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Here is an exercise replace this joker with Heath ledgers joker . It's really tough , isn't it ?? Heath's joker was pure evil and badass . All other jokers would fit in this trailer but not Heath's ."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gonna be an awesome movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can we just stop rehashing the same batman and joker shit over and over and over again?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Make up joker really who would like a joker that wears make up
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker is a comedian and citizen of Gotham City is his punchline.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Holly cow jack Is back guys fuck yeah
-_DJEzZk2pc,wow
-_DJEzZk2pc,No one like heath tho
-_DJEzZk2pc,Directed by Todd Scorsese
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is going to be awesome
-_DJEzZk2pc,The joker is right every tragedy can be turned into a comedy
-_DJEzZk2pc,"He's not the clown Gotham needs, he's the clown Gotham deserves"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wild immigrant kids and swollen jews in tuxedos push a good boy that never did nothing to breaking point. Based and redpilled movie. Will radicalize me. AY-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why is James Franco Not the joker??? Watch The interview n tell me he wouldn't hands down be the best joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,DCCCCCCC!!!! FUCK MARVEL!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The only & best Joker was Heath ladger
RIP  man"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Better then jared Leto
-_DJEzZk2pc,What the name of song?
-_DJEzZk2pc,the new joker looks like he lives in a society
-_DJEzZk2pc,Absolutely FKN INCREDIBLE LOOKING MOVIE!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,i like it!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So, did the society create mass shooters and lone-wolf terrorists or is the society continue creating them?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Meh
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why did I get a commercial for girl's doll playset to watch this Joker trailer?   Youtube.... you're creepy.
-_DJEzZk2pc,In my opinion DC should stay at dark story film. It suits them very well.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I heard ""Smile"" by Michael Jackson it feels so pure

""Smile"" by Jimmy Durante is another perspective, darker and anger"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like ass
-_DJEzZk2pc,is joker is a new BAT MAN ???
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can't wait for this film! So excited for Joaquin to become one of the most legendary Jokers!
-_DJEzZk2pc,big L
-_DJEzZk2pc,Pause at 1:37
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin, what happened? You're half your size. 
/I liked pudgy Nicholson Joker and against my own will enjoyed Ledger's sinister version."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"play hero go to gym
play villain dont eat"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"wow, what a talented play, well done Joaquin !"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please be as good as the dark knight. Please.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can‚Äôt stop watching it...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin seems like a great joker, Willem Dafoe would be one hell of a joker too"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"JP is great, but Jack Nicholson was the best Joker of all times!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This ain't the joker i knew,at least based on the killing joke"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Song?
-_DJEzZk2pc,The song sound like gotham but sometimes like joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like its gonna be another boring movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC?  Can't wait for them to fuck this one up too
-_DJEzZk2pc,*YAWN* There shouldn‚Äôt be another joker after heath.
-_DJEzZk2pc,reminds me Heath Ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,Never wanted this never will want this. stop
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It‚Äôs interesting how the Joker character keeps being played by the best talent out there. Every time there‚Äôs about to be a change of the actor, you go like, ‚ÄúNah, no one can do it better than [Nicholson/Ledger/Leto].‚Äù And then like, ‚ÄúHuh, [Ledger/Leto/Phoenix]? Well, it might work.‚Äù And it does! I have no doubt it will be a great Joaqer."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Macaulay Culkin - only one actor that could play Joker better.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I swear DC, this is the LAST CHANCE I give you after all the non-stop disappointment since Nolan's Batman."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Oh my i just cant wait for this to be out. It truly fit like gloves doesnt it. Joaquin & Joker. He, Jack & the late Heath are one of the best actors to ever potray Joker. Please cast Christian Bale back as Batman."
-_DJEzZk2pc,It‚Äôll never be the same without heath ledger. Rest in peace to a legend
-_DJEzZk2pc,"just admit it, we have a little bit of 'Joker' in all of us, waiting to come out.....  :)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Better not be build up's. Hope to be a good movie..
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dark Psychodrama lurks in this trailer. I have a feeling it will not be a good idea to take your young kids to this one  it is rated R for strong graphic violence and dark psychodrama of the human mind. Mikey likey.
-_DJEzZk2pc,1 like to the video 1 smile to joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The joker died when Heath Ledger died
-_DJEzZk2pc,2:01 oh shit dark knight returns reference? He‚Äôs totally killing everyone in the audience
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I‚Äôm not into superhero movies, and I totally get the criticism people are giving (what seems to be) this movie‚Äôs premise. But this trailer surprisingly makes me want to see the movie. I really expected to roll my eyes at it and move on.

The joker is a white dude committing teroristic acts and being glorified for it, blah blah blah, I get it. But a movie can be about something you disagree with, and still be interesting and entertaining. That‚Äôs how I feel."
-_DJEzZk2pc,every SOCIETY in this fkkkin world... deserve a JOKER..
-_DJEzZk2pc,DAMN üî•üî•üî•
-_DJEzZk2pc,"fuck  this movie, it dosent worth a penny"
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's weird but I could've sworn this wasn't Joaquin but the actor that plays Phil in Modern Family..
-_DJEzZk2pc,WHY IS NOT JEROME THE NEXT REAL JOKER AND NOT ALL THESE LIL CLOWNS??? HE‚ÄôS THOUSAND TIMES BETTER THAN EVERYONE BEFORE
-_DJEzZk2pc,"To all the people who thought it was fan made, suck a fat willy"
-_DJEzZk2pc,‚ÄòIs it me? Or is it just going crazy out there‚Äô it breaks my heart üíî
-_DJEzZk2pc,The word of joker someone says suddenly Heath ledger is comes my mind . The great legend are never dies (Heath ledger )
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:08
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hi hi Batman were are you??? .finally has fond the best figure of the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nice acting.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This man really went down hill since he lost his A.I. gf.. üòû
-_DJEzZk2pc,Life is a comedy... in the irony of reality...well said.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I was worried about this joker but after watching the trailer and seeing this mans disfigurement and hearing the manic cackle my worry‚Äôs are gone
-_DJEzZk2pc,these comments are edited this movie looks like a waste of 2 hours
-_DJEzZk2pc,"DC is such a shit pile, I guess they just want to make weak ass movies, the tv shows are better"

-_DJEzZk2pc,üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢
-_DJEzZk2pc,Thank God this was released around the Shazam release. That damn movie was so not DC that it nearly killed me. Glad to see them stay true to what they are with this trailer... Well or at least the appearance of it. We'll see when it's released... Right now looks stellar and I'm looking forward to it!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I like the fact it looks like it's heads towards the direction of art's ie over action leaves room for deep story telling fingers cross dc hits a home run with this one
-_DJEzZk2pc,Brilliant and refreshing. In some way the trailer looks like from a french art house movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don't like the actor
-_DJEzZk2pc,People expect you to behave as if you dontüòä.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Only a trailer & juaqine pheonix acting looks charlie Chaplin/ de niro esque. I hope dc doesnt fuck this up
-_DJEzZk2pc,I really hope this movie is as dark as it portrays itself to be.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yang 2020
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks a bit silly, and not very exciting. I would rather watch him fighting Batman than see his back story. It seems Hollywood is always trying to sell the next big star as the best joker ever, but we all know it was Heath Ledger."
-_DJEzZk2pc,No one can be a better Joker than Heath Ledger in my opinion. Rip Heath.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nobody will be better then heath leadger
-_DJEzZk2pc,One of the coolest parts about the joker is than he never told his backstory which made him nearly invulnerable (he also said that if he  had a backstory it would be multiple choice) its upsetting that DC might lose their greatest villain (in my opinion)
-_DJEzZk2pc,"kinda feels like 'you were never really there' was an audition, now."
-_DJEzZk2pc,this looks dumb AF
-_DJEzZk2pc,The sequel launches the Batman reboot.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope they burn this movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where is Harley???!!!!üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üíî
-_DJEzZk2pc,Meh it looks weak..
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Is this real,"
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:49 ... some Pennywise vibes right there
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why do they keep screwing up the origins?  Find a TPB of The Killing Joke - Joker started of disenfranchised and exploited; wife and baby accidentally died in a fire - the 'make-up' is permanent from skin discoloration after Batman accidentally bumped him into a chemical vat while Joker was trying to raid a factory to bring home money for his family. TKJ also explains the story taking place in Warner Bro.s Batman games.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Omfg this looks amazing
-_DJEzZk2pc,good choice for Joaquin Phoenix ;)
-_DJEzZk2pc,Marvels have made the 'Joker' character so complicated now that only Legends can play this role. Any new actor would be brutally thrashed by the viewers.
-_DJEzZk2pc,One of the best villains. Hopefully they don't ruin it. I think they should make a series for him.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ooommmgggg can't wait
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Not going to lie, I‚Äôm not as excited as everyone else in this comment section, the look of him really throws me completely off. That being said I‚Äôll give it a genuine chance. I hope it impresses me and gives me a joker that can live up to Hamill‚Äôs joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC light years ahead of Marvel
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This performance looks amazing!!!  Finally a movie showing me how the Joker got so screwed up in his mind...Production looks off the charts!!!  Can you say ""Best Actor"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,I blame Trump for the death of Heath Ledger #BarackObamaWillReturnInEndGame
-_DJEzZk2pc,I really like Joaquin Phoenix but NOBODY will play The Joker like Heath Ledger!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Who knew that Joaquin Phoenix could pull this off?? What an amazing actor
-_DJEzZk2pc,Old joker was way better... Just my opinion but still
-_DJEzZk2pc,"sjw an lbbklalaalaaa, its a movie, with a great actor, sorry, but not."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"woow, this one loooks awesome - and who else could do better then mr.phoenix...."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie looks crap
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Tf happened to Joaquin? He out here tryna be the Machinist. Also, no one follows Ledger in this."
-_DJEzZk2pc,First Shazam and now this? Are we ushering in a new era of not-dogshit DC movies?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don't know how to feel about this... I'm perturbed...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker has always been one of my favorite characters! I cannot wait until this comes out!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can we hit Heath Ledgers grave with lightning instead?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gothams lost it's way
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oscar!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker Bra
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is fucking creepy and great at the same time omfg
-_DJEzZk2pc,Cool
-_DJEzZk2pc,First time I cried watching a trailer üò¢
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's really heartbreaking that Gotham looks like it deserves the Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dark Knight joker >
-_DJEzZk2pc,Beni siz delirttiniz evet evet...
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is going to be great
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not even near to heath ledger. He has done the perfect work.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Now this is DC movie! Not much fantastic shit. Real movie full of hints, thinking, theories and hidden meanings. I hope Joker movie will be as good as Dark Knight"
-_DJEzZk2pc,You can tell already that Joaquin is gonna be the best Joker yet!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks like an interesting dark and gritty take on the Joker, but I am already saying  he doesn't compare to Ledger 's Joker!  I've seen people dressed up for Halloween that were better than Leto's abomination!  Ledger nailed it though!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,When I was young. Around 10-12. Me and my mates watch a martial arts film. No of us can remember the name. We would re hire it over and over. Everyone we showed it to thought it was awesome. Now we are all in our 40s. Out of all 10 of us. We have not been able to track down that film since. All we can mainly remember is that at the end the main guy is fighting with an axe in his side. Their is blood everywhere and he just keeps fighting with this axe sticking out of him for like 20 mins. It like this film has literally dissapered. We have all trawled the internet to no avail. Me and my mates are willing to pay 20 bucks to whoever can solve this annoying mystery for us.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like another oscar win for a joker role.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Like si crees que ser√° una obra maestra
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger R.I.Pü§°
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks completely retarded
-_DJEzZk2pc,"*. . . . In a world where DC attempts to reclaim it's own characters, mayhem and violence and chaos and such occur on a subway.* 
Costarring Sweet Dee as Catwoman, Fat Nicholas Cage as Batman. Plus Ellen's in there doing stuff! 

""*JOKER!* . . . Fuck it, let's do anything"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,This doesn't look good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Does this remind anyone else of taxi driver
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:09
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledgers joker will always have a special place in my heart as a dark joker but this new one looks like a Joker that is right beside heath in how well they portay him nd how jnto charaxter they are. Its not an act but rather a change of mind to preform this well.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Aw33
-_DJEzZk2pc,This listerally made my hair stand. This is so sad.
-_DJEzZk2pc,He won't be the best but he'll be almost there like Heath is a 100/100 and Phoenix is a 99/100

-_DJEzZk2pc,Seems lame ... but hey it's just a trailer !
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wackk
-_DJEzZk2pc,Eehhhhhhh why can't we wait a few more years before rebooting
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gives me Goosebump !!
-_DJEzZk2pc,The excitement is absolutely brewing inside me
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This isn't acting, its art."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie looks awesome!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Huge fan of Batman, but even since they fell off the dark knight road it seems to be getting worse. What happened to suicide squad 2 etc. Wtf is this. Joker fell in that liquid and was a gangster he wasn't a clown that turned crazy."
-_DJEzZk2pc,He is actualy pretty good now that he has aged a little
-_DJEzZk2pc,Imo could have got a better joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wtf.. no batman.. eat shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm here to represent clowns. This looks good. Oooh I'm hungry for it. I hate cinema, action movies, comic books, sleep, being awake, waiting for a place to wait.... for sleep while being awake."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Poor Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin will nail this....I have a feeling that his performance will get many awards...probably better than that of Heath Ledger.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Shit! This is gonna be good..
-_DJEzZk2pc,If only river could be here to watch this
-_DJEzZk2pc,It looks like a fucking Broadway drama...
-_DJEzZk2pc,There's no Batman. That sucks ‚òπÔ∏è I will not watch this movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Am i the only one who sees Phil Dunphy from Modern Family?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"What's the hell are they thinking? Joker = crazier V ? Joker  = the antihero the world deserve? Hwwwat? I smell some social justice redefine history scheme here.
Mind you, as there's no power actress to save the day, this movie will flop like nobody's business.
Also, Joaquin done good work in Gladiator, but I doubt he can do a good Joker here. A tragedical antihero the world deserve, maybe. But not a good joker~"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie is gonna be nuts
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I¬¥m not even a fan of Batman and although I¬¥m hyped for this movie I still everytime I see this feel like there is an essencial part of the Joker that is being changed here: for what I know from one particular scene of Heath Ledger Joker, he says that his father made his scars: ""Do you wanna know how I got these scars? My father was a drinker...and a fiend. And one night, he goes off crazier than usual. Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself. He doesn't like that. Not...one...bit. So, me watching, he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it. He turns to me, and he says, ""Why so serious?"" He comes at me with the knife - ""Why so serious?"" He sticks the blade in my mouth - ""Let's put a smile on that face!"" And... why so serious?""
 And yet in this movie, he doesn¬¥t have those scars"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks gay as fuck
-_DJEzZk2pc,What the fuck
-_DJEzZk2pc,"fun fact, Gotham is actually Detroit"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Classic. I can already tell.
-_DJEzZk2pc,12th time watching this
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Oh I see how he and Batman are similar. He broke down and became killing people while Bruce Wayne started beating people up. The joker was created by society and Batman was also created by society. Batman is also insane but his insanity is disguised as the world's greatest detective while the joker doesn't hide his insanity. :0

Edit: they've both been through trama. Trama is the cause of Batman AND the Joker. To be honest, I'd have my own gang in Gotham called the Peacekeepers. We would fight whoever disturbs the peace. Its contradictory because we cause more chaos but that's the idea, but there's only the lack of chaos. Its just another gang with an insane boss."
-_DJEzZk2pc,That laugh bruh...looks awesome
-_DJEzZk2pc,"loved him since I saw clay pigeons when I was, like, five lmao"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Rise up gamers
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ya...this looks like a great character study of a man abused by poverty, neglect, ridicule, and torment, that appears to sustain CTE, who happens to learn revenge is a side best served smiling. The Joker üÉè WAS just a man left unjustified, if your life‚Äôs a comedy then when you fall down it‚Äôs not sad, it‚Äôs laughable. The abuse has no impact, he‚Äôs learned it only hurts if you let it, and what he becomes is something fearless. I like that it‚Äôs starting early, methodical, if this gets dark then bring back the real Batman..C.Bale."
-_DJEzZk2pc,he did't seem quite... dangerous enough..
-_DJEzZk2pc,"‚ÄúI used to think that my life was a tragedy but now I realize, it‚Äôs a comedy‚Äù.

-_DJEzZk2pc,why do they keep doing origin movies. no one cares. make joker blow some shit up and fight batman thats what everyone wants. not some elaborate birth story ffs
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks dark. Loving it. He‚Äôs perfect for this part.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie should be a tribute to the best actor to ever play the joker heath ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,Lmao. Give this character to a real crazy person. It all makes sense
-_DJEzZk2pc,Best joker. Make this man joker for the rest of time.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Corny I will not be in attendance
-_DJEzZk2pc,üëäüëç

-_DJEzZk2pc,Hoooooly shit!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can‚Äôt get enough of this trailer. October is a million years away
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks like shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,The best Joker is still Mark Hamill. :)
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I normally don't give two hot shits about new Marvel/DC movies; it's WAY too overdone. However, this looks like it might actually be good."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"No one will ever be able to ""beat"" Ledgers Joker because it was really the first one in adult setting.  Nicholson in the 80s was good, but still cartoonish.   pg13.  Letos was good , a lot different.  They really didn't have a choice to go completely different or it would just seem like a cheap ripoff of the Dark Knight.  Itll be interesting to see how it looks when Pheonix plays it.  If it's just dark and creepy- we had that with Ledger. So they'll just be compared.  People will pick sides.  Like everything else these  daysü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.  Hopefully itll be completely different.   One thing about Letos joker, you never thought of Ledger when he was playing.   2 totally different characters. Hopefully itll be the same this time.  Something completely different that we dont even think of a comparison and they just stand alone"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like a good movie to watch
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gtfo my recommended fuckk üò≠üò≠
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Heath ledger will always be the top joker ever to be created, but you have got to know how the pain in just this trailer is exactly what every joker should have been about. . Phoenix's purpose, was meant for this. The start of his time his here. THE JOKER."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I think I figured out what's bugging me about this movie.  First off this breaks canon.  I mean that's fine, it's just a reboot of Joker, ok.  The problem is with this new telling of Joker, NOW the police have a record of who Joker is as he became Joker taking away some of the mystery of who Joker is when Batman is around.  Meaning this imagining of Joker just doesn't work in the Batman universe.


Remember when the Joker strikes when Batman is around the police nor Batman have any clues to lead to who the Joker is."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Terrible casting choice. Another flop for DC
-_DJEzZk2pc,When I heard about this I wasn‚Äôt sure but now I‚Äôm sold
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not good
-_DJEzZk2pc,It‚Äôs weird and imo not good if everyone feels sorry rooting for joker now...including myself. I think the joker character should always be feared /scary and hated and twisted evil. But we‚Äôll see what entire film has in store.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why
-_DJEzZk2pc,My phone that has been chipped and cracking for 2 years broke today after watching this trailer. I recorded a small video to post about how I love it and it literally broke in my pocket.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Christ....this looks like complete ass. üëéüèº
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is most of our lives in this dark dark time of humanity. Time is only an illusion though, it makes it poetry though."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Good Joker movie.
I think it‚Äôs a big prequel before Batman Begins. 
It‚Äôs okay, but I rather see how the movie goes"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Juaquin Phoenix will be the greatest Joker and will surpass Heath Ledger and Jack Nicholson for sure
-_DJEzZk2pc,"No le llega al guason de Nolan,"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It so DARK and DEPRESS. This is what we want from DC movies.

COME ON TAKE MY MONIE üòÅ"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Atlanta season 3 confirmed
-_DJEzZk2pc,This will definitely flop at the theaters.
-_DJEzZk2pc,this looks sooo shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I love how his style is very Heath ledger joker like, Phoenix is defiantly filling big shoes but his acting seems to be really powerful. Really looking forward to this"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I like this take on The Joker...it's fitting considering the current state of things.

-_DJEzZk2pc,The joker that we badly needed
-_DJEzZk2pc,"You can try, I‚Äôll give you that, however no one can or will ever do it better than the late Heath Ledger"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nope. Can't do it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,THIS looks like a fucking movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks like trash!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Est√° pel√≠cula tiene dos opciones:

-_DJEzZk2pc,"The joker is in us all , we just need a push"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like shit as expected. Played out.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gotham deserves the Joker not Justice...
-_DJEzZk2pc,This seems some
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like DC movies are starting to find their footing. I'm excited
-_DJEzZk2pc,Just a trailer and its powerful af.. can't wait to see the movie..
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin Phoenix is way better than Jared Letto, he was the worst joker ever!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This seems like another Weirdo liberal movie!!!!!:(
-_DJEzZk2pc,To all the people who came here to dickride Heath Ledger pls kill yourselves
-_DJEzZk2pc,I love Joaquin
-_DJEzZk2pc,Doesn‚Äôt look so great good
-_DJEzZk2pc,Here comes another huge disappointment from D.C.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie looks so stupid.
-_DJEzZk2pc,It looks like a waste of time this joker looks like a pussy
-_DJEzZk2pc,"lol you think that if i see a clown, on a train, laughing to himself out loud, that imma go over there? nope, thats when i get off at the next stop and walk home"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"My goal is, when watching this movie, to not compare it to Heath Ledger's version. That was a great performance, and I want to judge this performance on its own merits--not in comparison."
-_DJEzZk2pc,It would be awesome if Batman could make an appearance
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wah! Dahsyat! Amazing! Trailernya mantabs! Harus nonton!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can't wait for this movie to come out but it's months from now üòëüòõ
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Jim Carrey as Joker, Avrile Lavigne as Harley Quiin."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"1:14-1:23 is the scariest thing I've seen in a while. Like creepy scary, true to how joker would be like in the real world. Dark af."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Imiss heath ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think the real question is what happens to the Joker‚Äôs mother through the movie?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Does this movie take place outside of the DCEU?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can anyone say....Oscar??!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie looks so bad
-_DJEzZk2pc,Other kid movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Badass I Want To See It
-_DJEzZk2pc,Shit looks horrible to much talking it‚Äôs the joker and I didn‚Äôt see one person die a bomb nuthin
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Unfortunately, this movie will fail! üòÇ"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is the joker that we needed!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I don't understand this Joker version. I thought the Joker was a criminal who fell into a vat of chemicals by Batman, and this is what made him what he is."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Buffalo Bill???
-_DJEzZk2pc,Eric Andre would be a good joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I love the way he walks in the beginning  broken depressed beaten 
And at the end of the trailer he walks with great confidence. Badass!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can't wait for them to fuck this up
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is to Joker we need.
-_DJEzZk2pc,It‚Äôs got a weird silence of the lambs feel. Freaking awesome!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I thought Jared Leto was DC‚Äôs Joker? So they replaced him?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I love how realistic this is but it really is accurate for some cases this is really touching and beautiful.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don't see Batman in the trailer.
-_DJEzZk2pc,STOP ALREADY.......PLEASE!
-_DJEzZk2pc,RIP Heath Ledger üñ§
-_DJEzZk2pc,So effing excited ü§óü§óü§ó
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks trash everyone knows he's supposed to blow up stuff and Rob Banks
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC just has a good marketing team... They know how to make good trailers but their films are fuckin wank
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not that cool
-_DJEzZk2pc,Did not realize Robert De Niro is in this!
-_DJEzZk2pc,He looks like Andy Kaufman.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please don't be another swing and a miss on a easy home run pitch for DC movies.....
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is there a single woman interested in this movie?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Great. So we're supposed to empathize for the Joker now
-_DJEzZk2pc,RIP Heath Ledger.  This movie would have been superhit if you were in it. üôè
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ding! Ding! Ding!......We Have A Winner!!!!! I can‚Äôt wait to see this movie:)
-_DJEzZk2pc,RIP heath ledger nobody will ever do better
-_DJEzZk2pc,:'(
-_DJEzZk2pc,Cannot stop watching this preview
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is his mother's name Martha?
-_DJEzZk2pc,smh why did they not use jared leto smh
-_DJEzZk2pc,Awesome trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,Going to be hard to do this role after Heath. Heath was insanely good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""Sometimes the Cruel World does not need a hero to change, but a monster"" Dracula"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This shit look wack af
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hes giving me Buffalo Bill vibes.  Ewww.
-_DJEzZk2pc,OMG not another DC movie!!!!!!!!! God Damn this pollution!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker origin story is actually sad
-_DJEzZk2pc,I get a feeling it'll‚Äã be better than justice league
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger and Phoenix are embodying to very different visions of the joker. And if this trailer is anything to go by then I think we have something very exciting on our hands.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Meh. I think it's a big mistake to actually do an origin story for the Joker. The less you know about his past the more effective he is as a villain. I especially liked the stories where the Joker would have a completely different answer every time he talked about his past.
-_DJEzZk2pc,everything is good except the Actor
-_DJEzZk2pc,Somebody get this guy a sandwich  he bony as hell
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don‚Äôt know why i cried watching this....
-_DJEzZk2pc,i dont see how this movie has anything to do with the batman
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So it looks like Joker has at least 40 years on Bruce. By the time he's old enough to be Batman, Joker's gonna be in a nursing home."
-_DJEzZk2pc,RIP numder 1 I love this joke he plays it like a god
-_DJEzZk2pc,I really do like the concept but its really making fear that this movie is going to be more of trying to understand joker then seeing his sinister side. Now this isn't a big issue till you realize that their are a lot of people that see joker differently but who knows the movie isnt even out yet.
-_DJEzZk2pc,... i really dont like how relatable this movie is. this joker is nothing like the previous ones. it hits too close to home. its too feasible. even ledgers interpretation wasnt as relatable as this one. i feel like a lot of people would come out messed up after watching this. ordinary people at that. tbh this era doesn't need a joker movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"you can't beat Heath, can't beat the heat"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Stunning.  Ready to Vote him Best Actor just for the Trailer.  Pheonix will go down as one of the most incredible actors of all time.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Jimmy Durante, sings Smile and Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker? Doesn't get much better!!! Two classics!!! :)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC is really 50 50 for a good movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,I like how his shoes spark when hes dancing on the stairs
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks amazing
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""always smile and put on a happy face"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin Phoenix entered the  Room.


Jared Leto left the building!!!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is over due
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is emotional and terrifying at the same time.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Can,t wait to see the movie"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Yeah this is gonna be shit, just like venom."
-_DJEzZk2pc,wow it seems that he gave justice to this role.
-_DJEzZk2pc,How to make a joker simple throw him into society .
-_DJEzZk2pc,"There is not NO ONE out there in the big screen that can reveal Sorrow as Joaquin Phoenix. From top to bottom, he sucks you in, from his walk to those eyes and and your heart goes with him in that Journey of Pain. I cant stop watching his movies. i dont understand why he does not make more movies?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fuck can't wait hahahahaha
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is my favorite type of villain. Most super hero movies have pretty one-dimensional ""bad guys"" that do horrible things because, well, they're just *evil.* This Joker is not like that. This is somebody you can oppose but still have sympathy for. God, I love good writing!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Please DC, no Batman that Swoops in and Saves the Day type of BS. Let the joker have some fun."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Let's keep Joaquin out of Mary Kate's apt in NY.. Don't need another tragedy.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Really doesn't look that great, kinda seems more like a pussified adult instead of the Joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joker in 1989: made from chemicals... 

wait no no this one has already been copied and pasted 3 times ."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix is a perfect match to play as the joker he is already strange in real life so this should be good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,And he's voiced by Mark Hammill!
-_DJEzZk2pc,that last shot. this joker looks like he turns into a giant bad ass.
-_DJEzZk2pc,creepy as a mutha f@@er....
-_DJEzZk2pc,"We all started as vulnerable, innocent , nice people. Until we got thrown into the real world"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is going to be good. Old fashion story telling without tons of computer crap. Leto who?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"See!? There! A good Joker! Was that so hard, DC!?

Seriously, who the heck was calling the shots before?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is gonna be good. I can feel it
-_DJEzZk2pc,trailer is just the joker getting beaten up
-_DJEzZk2pc,So where's Bruce?
-_DJEzZk2pc,...boring
-_DJEzZk2pc,I must be the only one that thinks this is gonna be boring as Hell
-_DJEzZk2pc,*I know I'm going to cry at this movie bc of how he gets bullied into being the joker...I cant wait for this movie*
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope the full movie keeps the tone of the trailer cause this is well put together
-_DJEzZk2pc,this is so depressing
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think the kid that he stretches a smile off with his fingers between the fence it's Bruce Wayne.
-_DJEzZk2pc,wtf....... I would rather watch sap form on a tree then watch this....
-_DJEzZk2pc,Who else gonna be pissed if they make him an anti hero like venom
-_DJEzZk2pc,Man McDonalds is getting crazy with the ads jeez
-_DJEzZk2pc,In my opinion they‚Äôre trying too hard for it to pull off and too much innovation is being done but still gotta give it to them for the dark scenery is off the hook absolutely.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Should've gotten Heath Ledger to do it...



Too soon?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yeah so this is R right?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I thought he was gonna carve a smile into his face
-_DJEzZk2pc,are they doing the whole Glasgow Smile thing? (cut ear to ear).. That was the coolest darkest part of the Joker imo.. even though im not totally sure if they had it in the original comics.. still think it was dope
-_DJEzZk2pc,Without heath ledger this movie would have never been made
-_DJEzZk2pc,GAVIN!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Jared Leto left the conversation
-_DJEzZk2pc,"not amused about the trailer, still wanting to watch to movie to see how close these other actors can get to Heath Ledger"
-_DJEzZk2pc,That laugh....creepy af
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hhmmm.
-_DJEzZk2pc,HOLY SHIT THIS LOOKS SO GOOD
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Where is batman in all this? A nice homage to arkham there, but I sure hope that Jokers character has an encounter with the caped crusader at some point."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Back off 14 year old white girls this is jokers moment!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks good
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can't wait!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks like it could be really good. But lets remember who made the Joker character so darn interesting in the first place.
-_DJEzZk2pc,October??? Wake me up when September ends.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"That moment when you were pissed off because you thought Joaquin Phoenix was all wrong for the role of the greatest villain of all time, only to see this trailer and feel it in your gut that maybe you were wrong..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,They shoulda had Jordan peele co produce this
-_DJEzZk2pc,"*Should have been the present-day Jim Carrey. I miss him.*

p.s.
At least my YouTube channel might compensate if you're down for...""Comedy."""
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Heath ledger was by far the best joker....wtf is this!?
DC what are you doing?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Let‚Äôs see  the bright side of pain!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This movie looks fucking retarded. 
The people who think otherwise are fucking retarded. 
Your negative reply is fucking retarded."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I see a best actor award for sure!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I like it more every time I watch it. It's heartbreaking.

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Maybe, just maybe, he's not crazy.......we are"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow! This film looks legit, I think pheonix will pull it off."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can't FUCKING wait!!!!!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Those scenes with the mom.  I know many man-babies attached to their moms like this and they are all basically Jokers in waiting.  TEACH YOUR KIDS TO BE MEN! This movie is a PSA for parents.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I have to see this movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Almost no words to describe how fucking amazing this is! Seeing J. Phoneix walk down the hallway as the Joker fully formed gave me such Joy n awe! Also the couldn't of picked a better song, especially at the hallway scene where it's just the music n the dramatization of it is spectacular! This is a old song but I think it was still made for it"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaqu√≠n Phoenix vs Heath Ledger vs Jack Nicholson vs Jared Leto vs It vs Ronald McDonald vs Trump : Battle of the Clowns
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow this looks surprisingly good
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I kinda don't like that it seems based on society, I thought this would be comic based but I can't judge yet so I'll wait til it comes out."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ive never seen something so hyped up and i LOVE IT
-_DJEzZk2pc,not really that good. kid of weird...
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel him. I also turned a little crazy from society
-_DJEzZk2pc,In the first 40 seconds this made me feel sympathy for the Joker......The Joker.  That's impressive.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Bro the suit tho!!üòéüòé
-_DJEzZk2pc,Cant wait to see this ...we go have to see bats
-_DJEzZk2pc,This actually gave me goosebumps at the end.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow....now I know why the joker does what he does PEOPLE ARE THE REAL MONSTERS.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Man..jack nicholson and heath leger was the dopest and homie from the suicide squad was dope to tho
-_DJEzZk2pc,Roger Federer?
-_DJEzZk2pc,una verga
-_DJEzZk2pc,Holy crap joker is the best villain commoditen
-_DJEzZk2pc,The man abandoned by the society became to fall in love with Windows operating system..

-_DJEzZk2pc,Can anyone please tell me the name  of music
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This honestly looks so good it makes me have shivers up my neck. Joaqin Phoenix has always seemed a bit touched in real life, this is perfect for him."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Penis
-_DJEzZk2pc,This makes me feel worse about how joker was treated
-_DJEzZk2pc,His back looks so weird.
-_DJEzZk2pc,People need to understand how bad ass this muther fucker is!!  This will be untouchable !
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Could be good...just remeber the entire point of the joker character was to be a hero against government, figuratively and literally. It was a hidden character to show the world how fucked up society and government is. If they dont embrace that train of thought then they fail"
-_DJEzZk2pc,The man's a great actor leto sucked
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'll pass. All the joker fans will be like. OMG. This looks great. When it looks like crap.
-_DJEzZk2pc,OMG!!!! Can't wait
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks shitty
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks like shit. Wtf. Most of the scenes is him dancing and getting his ass beat. Lol. Last joker was good.  What happened.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Lame background
-_DJEzZk2pc,This isn‚Äôt a thriller. It‚Äôs a sadder.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The first actor to be able to portray the joker since Heath Ledger. Jared Leto tried, really A+ for effort but the movie was shit, so was his portrayal. They are doing it, right now. Embrace what Heath Ledger did in the part and play off of it. Pick someone who isn‚Äôt a carbon copy but has a similar essence. Don‚Äôt make an identical Joker make up but definitely show who it‚Äôs inspired from. Do what is considered impossible and actually develop a character that is an icon in the entire comic book industry even further."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Bummy ass joker.. nothing better then Keith Ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,jeeeeeeeeesus...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not sure how I feel about the make-up though... Could look a bit more menacing hmmm
-_DJEzZk2pc,"really like joaquin but jesus they gotta stop making joker movies, what is he, the 5th or 6th one now? having said that, im very VERY glad they didnt go to lead-o again."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker at first in the vid was nice
-_DJEzZk2pc,is it me or did they just gave one of the most iconic maniac most evil best fucking character of all time the most wackest begging stories ever like might aswell keep it a secret leave us in that wondering stage of why? leave it as it is if you are going to mess it up this big like it looks so ridiculous doesnt even have the same joker make up. :( sorry just pissed cuz joker is my all times fav and i feel disappointed that his story is this trashy now. i liked the old original story where he fell in chemical.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Guaranteed DC can come up with a way to ruin the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin Phoenix is a brilliant actor, but this movie looks like garbage.."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is DC going to come out with a decent film?????????
-_DJEzZk2pc,Garbage
-_DJEzZk2pc,Atlanta.
-_DJEzZk2pc,He really is becoming one of the best actors of this age. Cannot wait to see this
-_DJEzZk2pc,The first thought I had when I watched this trailer was how an unstable youngster who has a joker cult is gonna be inspired to shoot up a theater... like the dark night...

-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks very good. Very creepy and he moves and acts like an actual clown. The acting is spot on. He creeped me out yet I felt sad at the same time. This movie looks like a work of art and I felt a range of emotions looking at him not to mention It's close to the comics. DC you got yourself a viewer
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why so serious?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"No, DC, no, now go back to your room  and think about what you've done. He doesn't have scars and definitely doesn't seem crazy or insane. You've either messed up the story line for this joker or did a bad job with the trailer."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ok Dcs last 2 movies creepin up on marvel
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sometimes you just need to swing away.
-_DJEzZk2pc,rip heath ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,This Movie is going to be an absolutly Masterpiece
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Damn dude, this looks like it's gonna be dope af"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Just give the role to Tommy Wiseau.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The ongoing debate forever will now be Heath v Joaquin
-_DJEzZk2pc,Bad list of cast. Richard Brake featured in Rob Zombies movie 31 proves this . Joaquin should have never been considered . If thier is a single genius at Warner Brothers they should look into this before they cast again . While Im at it whenand if a mew superman is chosen they should look at Evan Marriot. He was the first joe millionaire.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hope the movie doesn‚Äôt suck.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fuck yuo Veronica
-_DJEzZk2pc,So is joker kind of a good guy in this??
-_DJEzZk2pc,REPENT AND TURN TO THE BOOK OF MORMON
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie is going to bring a multitude of freaks out from the woodwork.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dam this gave me chills down my spine.
-_DJEzZk2pc,NO WAY
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Please let it be good.
I really don't know how to feel about it."
-_DJEzZk2pc,looks dumb
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The depth of this actor astounds me. Holy F***in Shit I've never been a fan of the whole DC comics thing, but if the movie can live up to this trailer and the portrayal of Joaquin Phoenix's fragile/broken humanity, it has to be a winner."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gotta look out for the white guys in business suits on the subway. Damn thugs.
-_DJEzZk2pc,That was freakin creepy....no I meant exciting.....no no it was scary..........crap it was all three.joaquin is back.
-_DJEzZk2pc,2:06 yo is that sexy vegan
-_DJEzZk2pc,Who else thinks jim Carey would of made a wonderful joker.....
-_DJEzZk2pc,No story reveal? No CGI? No bang bang BANG dramatic music? Maybe this movie will actually be great ... based off this trailer alone
-_DJEzZk2pc,"finally, DC are taking on actors that are perfect for the role instead of hiring jared leto"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sux
-_DJEzZk2pc,"A movie where we can understand the character. It's a drama, it could be the best DC movie.


(Ad:)
I mean a little bit, because this character is too complex. Sorry for not expressing myself well."
-_DJEzZk2pc,R.i.p to dude who played joker in the dark knight trilogy cause this right here is foolishness
-_DJEzZk2pc,"oh come on dc, we were breaking away from the dark stuff, what happened??"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Everybody is a little bit Joker. I am Joker too. Fuck the World
-_DJEzZk2pc,He's laugh reminds me of Cesar Romero but more darker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I will smile. Again, and Again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again, and again."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Let's hope for no aliens this time.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I can't be the only one who likes Jared Leto as Joker, right? I felt like he played crazy so well!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,You gotta love Walking Penis.
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:09 that was cringey asf
-_DJEzZk2pc,now Heath Ledger can rest in peace as his prime legacy is in the right hand
-_DJEzZk2pc,When are these fuck gonna come up with something new lmao
-_DJEzZk2pc,Brilliant. What a beautiful movie - refreshing to see evil understood. Joaquin Phoenix is a genius.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Disturbing beyond all measure......our modern society will eat this up....
-_DJEzZk2pc,Already over exposed.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks absolutely terrible
-_DJEzZk2pc,We live in society
-_DJEzZk2pc,"OMG PAPER BOY!! GANG GANG

anyway this movie looks shit"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This looks amazing! I wanted Joaquin to play Joker for many years. He will deliver.  I always liked the series of bad events origin, found in ""The Killing Joke.  Looks like this takes it further. If chemicals play apart, I would prefer the Joker to do it on purpose. I like the make up use better, personally. No need to fall into anything to have an insane addictive need to keep clown  make-up on. To me that is creepy insane. I like it."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow, an actual great movie trailer for what looks like a pretty good movie.... I'm not even a hard Batman or Joker fan and I'm pumped to see it"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Cool
-_DJEzZk2pc,i ll skip
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath ledger was so much better he was lengendary
-_DJEzZk2pc,He looks like they mixed Heath Ledger and Jack Nicholson
-_DJEzZk2pc,O shit I thought this would be gimmicky but theres real potential here
-_DJEzZk2pc,Poor joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,He played crazy well in U Turn when he was the Vanilla Ice clone called TNT. That still makes me laugh.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Its really sadüò¢üò¢
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks shit.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I dont think that the movie be good Heath ledger is the Best Joker ever and This Joker was shitt 
Greetings from austria"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix is probably getting critically acclaimed for his performance.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Is it just me that didn't get swept off my feet by this trailer - in fact, quite the opposite..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Holy Joker, what the damn hell. Now this is a trailer! A damn good one. I love how they are not showing us what this Joker will do to Gotham. I am expecting something big. They may screw it up, but acting wise, I have no doubt its gonna be damn fckn good. Oscar material probably."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"No lie, this shit looks dope af"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Does he kill like other jokers
-_DJEzZk2pc,And there are no spoilers!! So good
-_DJEzZk2pc,How is this joker they're going away from the narrative
-_DJEzZk2pc,La m√∫sica es la.m√°s triste q nunca escuch√©. Small de Chaplin  !
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So which is better,The Joker made from chemicals or society ?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,society
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fuck manü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èanyone else feel bad for him...
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:09 he‚Äôs learning to force himself to laugh even in the darkest times
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why does it have to come out in October I want it nowüò≠üò≠üò≠
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This movie won't be successful. Without the Joker IP this is just another run of the mil movie you see in the same genre. Joker has always been a supporting character to batman. Making Joker the main character of a movie in the form of an origin story is a bad idea. Even if you take heath ledger's joker character and have a movie run solely on the character it won't be any good. A movie solely about joker without batman involved will fail. The joker character is just not that commanding by itself. It won't be able to command a huge audience to see this, and since it has such a dark tone, parents won't take their kids hence losing more potential money. A lot of the success of the superhero movies is supported by parents take their kids. When superhero movie comes out families go see it. Stuff like this not so much."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Well, I think his jokes are funny. üôÇ"
-_DJEzZk2pc,The background music üëåüëå
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I have never been more excited for a movie, I seriously have the strongest hunch that this will be a masterpiece."
-_DJEzZk2pc,His performance as Commodus in Gladiator is by far his best. This might top it though.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I agreed with Heath Ledger's Joker far too often.
And sympathize with this one, even though my mental issues don't compare.
I wonder what it all means."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks horrendously bad.  DC needs to give up.  They are butchering comic book characters.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Damn I was scrolling down here expecting to see comments talking about how no one could ever play as good of a joker as Heath Ledger but apparently y‚Äôall wanna see this dude try. It will never compare in my eyes. Should‚Äôve stopped with Heath. RIP
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow what a piece of shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,It somehow makes me feel sad for the Joker. I hate it when innocent people who just want the best for others are bullied and tormented like that
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The ONLY thing I dislike about this film so far (I think it looks amazing) is the name ""Arthur Fleck."" I guess they were going for an unassuming, generic name, but to me his real name will always be ""Jack Napier."" I wish they had gone with ""John 'Jack / Jackie' Napier"". Movie still looks fascinating though."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks amazing. Can‚Äôt wait to forget Jared letos version !!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is gonna destroy the joker as a character
-_DJEzZk2pc,"On the one hand, I firmly believe the crux of the Joker is that he has no origin. On the other; he has about 17 or so, at least. What's one more?
Just remember, kiddies:

All it takes is one bad day..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Weirdest feeling. I literally can't wait but don't trust DC since how good the suicide squad trailer was / bad the movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wird ja mega schei√üe.....
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:08 looks like christian bale
-_DJEzZk2pc,"There is 2 sides to every story, hopefully this will show the reasons he does the things he does. There‚Äôs no such thing as ‚Äúevil‚Äù just misunderstandings"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ok, so they took Joker and made him a creepy mommy's boy a la every horror movie made in the last 20 years. Great stuff."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why can't  I  stop watching  this  üòä
-_DJEzZk2pc,Disappointing
-_DJEzZk2pc,good to see DC doing somthing else with their characters.
-_DJEzZk2pc,From brother bear to joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,It is not good without heath ledger.
-_DJEzZk2pc,:56 is that Jal from Skins?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh Kenai
-_DJEzZk2pc,You don't realize how much you don't have until you start wanting more.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I think the Dark Knight Joker was also made from the toxic factors of society, specifically due to his intoxicated father."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hollywood should just start cranking out Joker movies with a new actor each time like colonels in KFC commercials. Next Up: Shia LaBeouf.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is about Robin Williams?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks crappy
-_DJEzZk2pc,If this was NOT titled Joker then I would think this was great.  But this shouldn't be titled Joker. He seems way too old. Plus I think most fans have a preconceived notion of how they picture Jokers early life. Then they say Gotham lost its way.  He is a great actor but this isn't Joker to me.  I'm sure people feel different.
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's beautiful.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is great redemption for the monstrosity that was Suicide Squad's Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Finally someone worthy of the Joker title. Cannot wait to watch this! Obviously, Heath Ledger was on another level but this looks quite promising."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now I feel sympathy for him. Damn actors toying with the feels
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Base on the thumbnail alone, I think the joker in this movie try too hard to portray himself as crazy. It doesn‚Äôt seem right. Actor doesn‚Äôt come off as joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I am sorry, but even if this guy looks damn cool, you simply CAN NOT become ""The Joker"" beyond Heath Ledger."
-_DJEzZk2pc,So the joker's a hero in this one.)
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is it kid friendly
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fuck Marvel.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"damn this makes you really think...




we live in a society üòî"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Did we watch the same thing? This looks fucking horrible!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,they're going to fuck this up with YET ANOTHER Social Statement...They're going to shit on the source material and make up their own Joker Creation.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wheres homeboy that did joker in suicide squad..stop changing the fucking origin story
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is one of the most compelling trailers I've watched in a long time.


No intergalactic aliens invading earth
No fucking flying robots
No CGI

Just pure and honest story telling 

Phoenix  absolutely pulled me in with his portrayal and I've only seen the trailer..
Will definitely be watching.


Thank you DC, we needed this."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now yuo see
-_DJEzZk2pc,"WOW - cant wait to see this! .....I might actually go to the movie theater. Havent been in years because the seats kill my back and neck. Only reason I can even THINK of going now is the new CBD roll on I've been using on my neck and back. It helps fast. If you go see the Joker movie try out tampacannabisoil.com first  - Heck, if you order now, you''ll have it IN TIME to see the movie!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,The orphanage boy in 1:50 looks like robin
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Not the same without Heath ledger, beat performance in the last 20 years"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Does rhe comedy club name say pogo's? Like pogo the clown. John wayne gacys clown name, i believe"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Amazing Lucas brought me here. Ohhhhhh my g√ºdness! This looks epic!
-_DJEzZk2pc,WE
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Just from the trailer he‚Äôs better than Jared Leto, who sucked beyond belief.

I reckon this incarnation will be the best, the product of a messed up society. Joaquin Phoenix is perfect"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ah this looks fantastic <3 so interesting
-_DJEzZk2pc,their will never be another joker... sorry but this aint it.....
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks ass
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hola joker de heath ledger de 2008 fue el mejor guason saludo
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Gotham is crazy




Me: has it always"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Maybe its just me, but I think Robin Williams would have made a good Joker character."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I have to say, Jack Nicholson was my favorite Joker, Heath Ledger did pretty good too, Jared Leto's version should be erased from history all together. But Joaquin Phoenix looks like he might be better than Heath, maybe on par with Jack. We'll see..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,this movie is gonna be ass
-_DJEzZk2pc,This guy Phoenix at certain angles looked like Jim Carey and at other angles he looks like if ray liotta had his kids that had babies that fucked each other and had a inbred kid that fucked some inbred ugly white chick and had a baby and grew up is what he looks like
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath ledger was betterüëå
-_DJEzZk2pc,Commodus Return
-_DJEzZk2pc,Shit looks so assüòÇ
-_DJEzZk2pc,Phoenix is the man for this
-_DJEzZk2pc,Insanity villains are the best villains
-_DJEzZk2pc,"After Heath Ledger killed this roll,  I don't think anyone can live up to him... JS"
-_DJEzZk2pc,The face paint need to look more terrifying
-_DJEzZk2pc,All I'm seeing is one big üí£
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath joined the room.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Boring movie from the trailer! Phantom of the opera has more action
-_DJEzZk2pc,I didn‚Äôt know Steve vain played the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie looks wack as fuck lol
-_DJEzZk2pc,this movie is for males only
-_DJEzZk2pc,I  hope Joaquin Phoenix doesnt suicide after this movie..
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Not gonna lie, it kinda looks like ass"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ooooo he‚Äôs so deep and sick. It‚Äôs our fault!
 Cut print gay."
-_DJEzZk2pc,WOW... and people wonder why I say that joker is a hero?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Anybody else think its lame that he looks almost exactly like Ledger's joker, only with shittier make up?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Idk what all of you were watching but this movie looks terribble , I mean i was waiting for the hip hop song to start.... lol this dudes a joke not a joker. Were the hek is Batman. Cant have joker no Batman wtf"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I‚Äôm not going to see this. Heath Ledger already won the Oscar for his portrayal of the Joker a few years ago. Why Hollywood keeps remaking the same movies is beyond me. 

Another study of madness and craziness? What do they want to say this time? Mama, Weer All Crazee Now? Societies Crazy! Your Crazy! I‚Äôm Crazy! I get it! Enough with the Craziness! It‚Äôs not that interesting or unique. If I want to hear something crazy I‚Äôll watch the News every night. 

I‚Äôd like to see an inspirational story not one about madness! Enough Already! 
Bye Hollywood!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,he walks like Jack Nicholson after getting insane with the axe in the shining
-_DJEzZk2pc,"No wonder he became the joker, he was treated so badly"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Beautiful
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dang it. I told myself I was done with this comic book movie bs. Ok. This one gets a pass
-_DJEzZk2pc,He's a great choice
-_DJEzZk2pc,We were given something very special when Heath Leger did the Joker and looking at this trailer I think we are going to be given yet another by Joaquin Phoenix!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"this movie is going to be so bad that heath ledger will feel it on his grave. Jesus christ! what a horrible acting this is, for someone who is fed up with all the special effects such as cgi's and other bullshits, making marvel and dc superheroes comedians just to earn more money. i have nothing to say more... i stopped watching the hero and super hero movies after the dark knight, for someone who grew up with all these excellent movies such as the first three spidermans, batmans xmens this seems horrible. I really wish that i would be wrong and this movie will be a great one. but unfortunatly i dont think so..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gay
-_DJEzZk2pc,I now realize joker is the good guy &bat man is evil!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Lame ass joker 
Dark night joker is the best hands down"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks boring as fuck
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger...
-_DJEzZk2pc,@1:08
-_DJEzZk2pc,October what year?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Used to think my life was a tragedy
Now I realize it's a comedy"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yeah but why does he sound like Chris Griffen?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Plz put some Japanese people in this movie if you want to make the joker look like this...
-_DJEzZk2pc,So Commodus finally went even more insane.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Pathetic
-_DJEzZk2pc,Made by sjws
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why so sirious?
-_DJEzZk2pc,im fucking hyped!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Lame
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Skipping this movie. There have been too many bad movies in the past 5 years that if a movie Trailer doesn't grab my attention, i'll have no interest in watching a movie whatsoever. This ls not one of those movies."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"rofl hollywood has become such shit, this seems like comedy"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why is this being made?
-_DJEzZk2pc,the last thing we need is this movie radicalizing more white males
-_DJEzZk2pc,I need this. Right. The fuck. Now.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can already tell I might cry during this. I hate seeing someone get picked on who doesn‚Äôt deserve it/is innocent. (Before he turns bad)
-_DJEzZk2pc,Kind of reminds me of Falling Down
-_DJEzZk2pc,"oh how unusual, a dc movie trailer with no plot"
-_DJEzZk2pc,That was beautiful üò¢ü§°
-_DJEzZk2pc,No Batman no coins from me ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
-_DJEzZk2pc,River would be so amazed
-_DJEzZk2pc,Who the fock is that guy
-_DJEzZk2pc,just keep playing 1:09 over and over again
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger has left the chat.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks so good ! :0 definitely going to watch it ! :)
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker bra
-_DJEzZk2pc,GIWWIT 2 ME
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Tbh this movie actually looks good don't see why people are hating on it already
And if its because it isn't his ace chemicals origin then remember batman is the reason he fell in

Or if its the fact that all other DC movies have Been dog then give it a chance like shazam"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally DC makes a horror movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gay!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"When I was thinking that NO ONE will top Heat Ledger, this JOKER comes up. . .

CAN HARDLY WAIT!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Another traumatic sad movie oh joy.. üòí
-_DJEzZk2pc,THE HYPE
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Something is missing..

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks cool, n'est pas?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"y'all need to hear mike mike and oscars weekly show. they hit the nail on the head w/ this trailer. yea it's great but like....idk I just feel like there's some badness too right?
https://soundcloud.com/mikemikeandoscar/mmow040819"
-_DJEzZk2pc,How many joker variations can there possibly be after awhile?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"hmm was really disappointed when i read jaquin phoenix was going to do this roll, but have to say the trailer  actually looks pretty good."
-_DJEzZk2pc,That thumbnail was frekin EERY
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger vs Joaquin Phoenix...interesting
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I am confused. Spent a while waiting for the new Joker movie with Jared Leto. When did they change him for Phoenix and why? Not that he doesn't look great in it but what the hell. I LOVE JL as Joker, everybody did, he was brilliant in it. They said they had a ton of extra footage with him which they will use for the movie so what is going on."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow, and this shows why so many of us oddballs are pulled to the character of the ""Joker"", as many of us are told to just ""always smile"", when dealing with the coldness that is the normality of society towards us. :). Also, anybody else notice that at moments he has the ""Malcolm McDowell"" look nailed down! :).

Let's just hope they won't fuck this one up."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ok naw I love this, full stop!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gamer rise up we live in a society
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Would you guys be friends with Arthur?




I know I wouldn‚Äôt"
-_DJEzZk2pc,There is Not a Single good dc Film. Also the Joker is boring dipshit Charakter. Worst Joker was this drug addicted fuck who died
-_DJEzZk2pc,Apparently this is meant to be an origin for heath ledger‚Äôs joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,So this is gonna be a soap opera drama rly? Give us Nolan!
-_DJEzZk2pc,That looked damn good
-_DJEzZk2pc,Bull shitt
-_DJEzZk2pc,My 11 year old son who loves Batman movies watched this and was disturbed. He thought nothing of Heath's Joker and that was a masterpiece. This looks creepy and terrifying.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Anybody remember how awesome the Suicide Squad trailers were? I‚Äôm not getting excited just yet.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Batman's intelligence is not worth mentioning in front of clowns ÔºÅ
-_DJEzZk2pc,gay
-_DJEzZk2pc,No one will be able to overcome Heath Ledger!
-_DJEzZk2pc,He looks like trevor
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Not sure if we're missing it but this spin on Joker seems depressing, painting him as a sympathic character. The trailer doesn't inspire or excite."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Amazing.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,this looks so good wtf
-_DJEzZk2pc,"ledger :  Their morals, their code; it's a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be. You'll see- I'll show you.

-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks awefu
-_DJEzZk2pc,As long as this either isn't in the main universe or ends with him in arkham saying that he keeps remembering it differently or preferable both then I think I'll enjoy this movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I almost vote for Gotham's Harley Quinn or someone even more diabolical. An ugly duckling orphan that was bullied throughout her life type to be his partner in this one. The current  good looking Harley and her Joker fit well together so I would still like to see them work together.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"makes me want to cry. looks like a phenomenal film, but i don't think i could enjoy watching it--too depressing."

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Venom without Spiderman and Joker without Batman... since copyright was more important than logic, more important than art, comic movies will be shit still for a long time. Its a pitty, beacuse Phoenix look fucking good"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I used to think that my life is a tragedy, but now, I think it's a comedy. - Joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Pidr
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Sorry, but that's not the Joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin will certainly hold up his end. I only hope the writing team holds up theirs.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I bet the scene where the joker is smashing his face against the glass mirror is because his mother just died in that made him snap to fully become the joker one bad day
-_DJEzZk2pc,They've got to stop making these Joker films
-_DJEzZk2pc,They just shouldn‚Äôt of knocked the sign out if his hands
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Se ve mala la pel√≠cula en si, la trama y el dise√±o del Joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Basura de trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie is gonna do really good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger will always be the best Joker ever made. Anything else was just a real shitty version. Period.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Guys if you pause at this time 1:28 for a second you can see that he is angry and he basically snaps
-_DJEzZk2pc,Best Joker yet? Yes.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Trash
-_DJEzZk2pc,Im convinced u guys are all bots. Because nothing from that trailer made it seem like a good movie lmao
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh would Heath Ledger be amazing in this role‚ù§Ô∏è
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope they get this right....so far he's the best villan we have.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Idk.............
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Omfg, pheonix will be great in this"

-_DJEzZk2pc,Why is everyone beating him up?
-_DJEzZk2pc,where is joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Who knew Ty Burell would look so good in clown makeup.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Epic gamer moment
-_DJEzZk2pc,Doesn‚Äôt look good
-_DJEzZk2pc,The oscar is coming!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Willem defo shoulda been the  joker üÉè
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This looks stupid, nothing can top Heath Ledger."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is that little kid behind the fence Bruce Wayne?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Get a load of this society.
-_DJEzZk2pc,the only trailer i watched several times for how good it is
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So basically, the birth of the Joker could've been prevented with the right mental health support, lmao."
-_DJEzZk2pc,His face paint reminds me of Jack Nicholson's Joker and the hair reminds me of Heath Ledger's Joker. Nice mix.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Let's put a pretty little smile on your face. JOKER
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is the first movie I've been interested in watching in years.  I'm not a DC or Marvel fan boy, I'm pretty disappointed with the sjw slant that they all seem to be going down. I'm just talkin about movies in general, this one actually looks like it might be worth a darn. It may not be an original story, but at least they're trying!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Classic
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nahh
-_DJEzZk2pc,Give this man oscar already
-_DJEzZk2pc,Marvel makes better movies and does better with less popular characters unlike DC
-_DJEzZk2pc,Phil dumphrey  gone mad !
-_DJEzZk2pc,"There's only one true joker "" Heath Ledger ‚ù§"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Well alright hell of a trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Jokes :
The worst part of having a mental illness people expect you to behave as if you don't"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I really think this man could be as good as heath ledger.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks dope
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm actually interested in a DC film
-_DJEzZk2pc,His laugh is amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
-_DJEzZk2pc,‚ÄúWhat doesn‚Äôt kill you makes you stranger‚Äù

-_DJEzZk2pc,Booked. I gotta go see this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I prefer the original origin stories. I am NOT watching this crap, its another case of the Warner Brother whores trying to milk as much money as they can from DC characters with out actually doing the character any real justice."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Name song name song name song pleaseeee üôè
-_DJEzZk2pc,I miss Heath
-_DJEzZk2pc,"@ Big Izz
Joker is Us
Chemical society"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"An absolutely amazing trailer.
But it doesn't feel like the Joker at all.
It would fit the breakdown of an actual clown, but not the transformation of a normal person into the man other supervillains have nightmares about."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Brandon lee would've made a perfect joker if he was still alive.R.I.P
-_DJEzZk2pc,TRash
-_DJEzZk2pc,"... I just.... really don't want to see Batman in this film
I imagine Mr. Phoenix's take on DC pure"

-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow these mcdonald ads are getting out of hand
-_DJEzZk2pc,o sam bag pla
-_DJEzZk2pc,what the fuck is this disney shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Nicholson was the mob boss joker who could actually fuck a model. Ledger was a loose cannon, crazy for the sake of being crazy. Phoenix will be the people's joker, a Travis Bickle in clown make up."
-_DJEzZk2pc,''I used to think that my life was a tragedy but now I realize it's a comedy.'' I'm agree him.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I‚Äôm intrigued to see where they go because the Joker has always had no name, no back story, no rhyme or reason: which made him the badass villain that he is.

This looks SO good I hope they don‚Äôt fuck it up."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"They are IMO trying to show the human and likeable side of the Joker. If you ever watch the cartoons he is pure evil, there are NO redeeming traits that he has."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Thank god we do not have to see another Jared Leto Joker...
-_DJEzZk2pc,That will be a great movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,What‚Äôs the song?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Great, another non heath ledger joker lets hope this one's better than that walking trashcan from suicide squad"
-_DJEzZk2pc,All ready the best joker of all time!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,any gang weeders
-_DJEzZk2pc,This trailer is creepy ngl
-_DJEzZk2pc,Who else felt so sad on his bullying seens when he is just trying to be happy and they beat him to a pulp
-_DJEzZk2pc,"No no no no NO. He just looks like a clown.. The Joker isn't a fucking clown. This isn't 'IT'
Doesn't look great tbh."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don't know about this. I'll have to wait and see the movie to give some real thoughts
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks very shitty and that is putting it mildly.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is like my 6th time watching the trailer already
-_DJEzZk2pc,The trailers shows its some nut running around in clown makeup and thats about it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Here we go; part 100 from the same BS
-_DJEzZk2pc,He's gonna get an Oscar for this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is so far is the creepiest thing I ever seen and I play a lot of horror games
-_DJEzZk2pc,Osea que el Guas√≥n era puton....o como?.....XD
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I really hope Joaquin Phoenix doesn't get messed up after this movie. He looks so into the character."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I like Joker made from chemicals much better.
because joker made by society gives you a sense of hopelesness."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I desperately -want- need this movie to be good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"2:10 come on, that walk alone shows the greatness we are going to watch! I would definitely move out of his way."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Yall remember how good the suicide squad trailer was

-_DJEzZk2pc,RIP Heath Ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,I still think they should of picked  jim carry when he was younger
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks rubbish. This guy ain't got nothin on heath ledger. Crap joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Robert De Niro?? I'll pass!
-_DJEzZk2pc,He's going to be the best joker there has been! He will do us proud
-_DJEzZk2pc,'JOkER' meaning Where's in the film whereeee*''
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wtf from what I seen this isnt nearly enough bad things that happened to joker to justify his craziness
-_DJEzZk2pc,bad as fuck
-_DJEzZk2pc,Anyone but me see the look and movements of heath ledger's joker. The throwing away the mask as he's running from the cops the walk his clothes and the hip thrust or the lil dance on the steps
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is that the joker or the clown? Wtf
-_DJEzZk2pc,No one cares about Joker Marvel is better
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Nothing will ever beat Heath Ledgers joker

All three Batman movies are the best"
-_DJEzZk2pc,i think this will be good but not magical like Heath Ledger JOKER
-_DJEzZk2pc,Batman i feel bad about the joker now
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is it only me or is he doing a Tommy Wiseau impersonation?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Cast Scott Adkins as Bruce Wayne. Please and thank you!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Batman i feel bad about the joker now
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker be like : A boy's best friend is his mother
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin Phoenix to Hollywood :  Let's make a low budget character study of the Joker. 

Me to the world: Just hand me the popcorn and slowly back away."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This better be a good movie getting tired of all the dc movies being so corny. So far marvel been coming out with better movies.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can't wait!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gotta see this one..a real descent in hell
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Hands down, this is the best looking trailer i've seen in years. Whoever put this together is good. Props to the whole team!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Thank god DC are finally getting it right and focusing on more character
 driven stories. Hopefully, the movie will be as good as the trailer 
looks."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Cant wait üò≤üëçüíú
-_DJEzZk2pc,"i like the trailer and the concept of this movie but still im not sure whether i want to believe that there will ever be a better ""joker"" than heath ledger... r.i.p."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Absolute dog shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,Someone get him a *happy* meal asap
-_DJEzZk2pc,Have you ever danced in the pale moon light....
-_DJEzZk2pc,"He kills the guy on the train, which triggers his other side. Then he becomes Joker. Such a beautiful trailer. Oscar for sure is in the making."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wake me up when its over...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Im thinking im finally too old for this stuff. The joker getting his ass beat by weak pedestrians? Twice? And this man will evade batman? Ok
-_DJEzZk2pc,"No one will ever top Heath Ledger as ""The Joker"" in my eyes."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Jared leto is better
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hit ledger is the one and only joker no one can replace him
-_DJEzZk2pc,Seems he got mad because Marcus Aurelius chose me to be his successor .....
-_DJEzZk2pc,"They should have left it alone out of respect, nobody will commit to going nuts like Heath Ledger did."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is going to be epic.. Joaquin seems perfect in the part
-_DJEzZk2pc,That fucking laugh üëå
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin is perfect for this role needs someone to go dark. Go real dark. Before insanity.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"When I heard they were making a Joker origin movie, it sounded like a pointless cash grab that would detract from the mythology.  THIS trailer though is extremely well made, if this is what the movie looks like I can't see them flubbing it.  Perfect cuts and song pick.  Joaquin Phoenix didn't blow me away in Gladiator or Quills but he has all the looks and mannerisms down here.  I feel like this could either be Heath Ledger's Jokers origin, Killing Joke or it's own thing.  Heavy Taxi Driver vibes on it which I think is the right way to do it"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I have lost absolutely every ounce of respect for DC after justice leauge. But this... This has to be one of the best trailers I have seen.. I am giving them another shot and I HOPE SO FUCKING MUCH that they dont blow it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I need an explanation why Willem Dafoe hasn't been joker yet.  BUT... this looks wonderfully twisted.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Mmm quite promising...
-_DJEzZk2pc,another fucking joker movie come on guys might be good though cus hes a great actor but fucking milking the shit out of the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm a DC fan but this looks WACK! Not interested!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like hot garbage
-_DJEzZk2pc,"As a lifelong comic book fiend and Joker obsessed fan, I was praying Scorsese would do what no one else had been able to.
Then I see this trailer and I see a movie for the Woker(Woke Joker). Yet another comic character with a library worth of story arcs, stand alones like The Killing Joke, and various commentaries about almost every facet the Joker's persona. A library of CANON material.
All of which has been shredded and those shreds thrown onto a fire. Yet another thing ruined by politics, SJW'S, and their feelings. Enabled by spineless people who are willing to bend the knee and be a ""yes man"" or ""yes woman"".
I'd rather be waterboarded then watch this travesty of a movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Toxicity should be on the soundtrack
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Why are you really getting so excited? Yes, the Joker is played by an incredible actor. But 
Todd Philips as director? It will reek of failure, as most DC movies. There is one, and only one man who has managed to do something immemorial - Nolan. And that's it. Which is the main difference with Marvel. They've found the perfect directors in the face of Anthony & Joe Russo."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I could see Heath Ledger doin this one sooo but soooo good!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Everyone one in this comment section is a r/Im14andthisisdeep
-_DJEzZk2pc,Did i see Myrtle Snow
-_DJEzZk2pc,What is this?
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks epic. He‚Äôs going to be the best joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ah......... Don‚Äôt fuck up this movie Joker is the Best villain in my eyes!üò°

-_DJEzZk2pc,I have always loved the joker and now there making a movie that is about him.....Now i got a smile on my face!!.üòÅ
-_DJEzZk2pc,this is a disgrace to the joker character
-_DJEzZk2pc,Well that looks like a shit movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,this trailer gives me goosebumps every time I watch it. I so can't wait to see the movie. genius
-_DJEzZk2pc,is Joker a good guy in this movie? from trailer it looks like it's a inspiring success story about a hero
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Honestly I don‚Äôt like it, there is always something alluring about joker (except for the one with the prince parade) I didn‚Äôt see anything like that in this film honestly it looks like most of the movie is going to just be a big long build up, that man looks too skinny and frail to be a real joker, when a man can‚Äôt even fill out a pair of tiety Whiteys, it‚Äôs time to get that man some food. And I really hate the clown get up, only at the end was It bearable but not perfect that makeup was too much like a regular clown honestly I think the hole thing just went in the wrong direction. And you see Bruce as a kid that man will not live to fight Batman he looks that old"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin Phoenix is a good actor don't get me wrong, but can he live up to Heath Ledger as the Joker? Also if Heath Ledger was still alive, think they would of made him do this role as well? Thoughts?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger will always be my joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fuck you Marvel
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks good :)
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Put on a smile, Am I not merciful?!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix is the right man for the job. He's going to kill it
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where's Batman
-_DJEzZk2pc,Mr Joker back in the game
-_DJEzZk2pc,sorry but this looks retarded :D after Healh Ledger there will be no other Joker :)  i will not miss watching this crap :D
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Some days, all you need to let a corrupt society poison your heart is a smile, and one bad day."
-_DJEzZk2pc,THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE FUCKING AMAZING
-_DJEzZk2pc,Unfortunately this will never be part of the DC extended universe
-_DJEzZk2pc,—Ö—É–π–Ω—è
-_DJEzZk2pc,Trash
-_DJEzZk2pc,i guess thats the one of the best trailer ive ever seen.....
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Releasing in October for all that ""best Halloween outfit"" cross-promotion."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Not sure what to make of this, it looks good but I‚Äôm unsure."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is going to blow everything and everybody away...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yep that's Joker! Finally the best Joker ever in future
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please tell me that I am not the only one who was left very confused by this trailer.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Sorry but nobody can match Heath Ledger's joker. Leave it alone, the joker is dead."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Doesn't Phoenix, in this role, have a kind of DDLewis look alike?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where's Batman during all this?
-_DJEzZk2pc,i use to thinks my life was a comedy now i realize it is a tragedy
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I saw this in my recommended.......





.... and I smiled"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"October suddenly seems like a long, long way away."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I was wrong for Joaquin pheonix selection. I think this will be the best movie of all time.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This movie is going to speak to a lot of people in a very personal way
Danger will robinson"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this the Joker‚Äôs and Buffalo Bill‚Äôs love child?
-_DJEzZk2pc,What the fffffuuuuuu ... this is awesome
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow... MY GOD!
-_DJEzZk2pc,....... What.....
-_DJEzZk2pc,2:13 FLOWERS...omg sorry but the new joker is...hot.
-_DJEzZk2pc,this is an appalling disaster of an origin story. that is all.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks stupid asf
-_DJEzZk2pc,Era de las pel√≠culas de villanos est√° comenzando  :'''') siiiiii !!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks interesting...Way better than the garbage Joker from Suicide Squad
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Now I see why people got pissed when other people said ""Captain Marvel should smile more"". Didn't work out for Joker. XD"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I have no idea what this is going to be about ü§îü§™
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks boring
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If not in this joker movie , they're gonna put harley quinn in the second one"

-_DJEzZk2pc,"The greatest DC trailer in history, I can't wait! üòä"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Anyone else happy for Zazie Beetz?
-_DJEzZk2pc,this will be epic. Can¬¥t stop watching this
-_DJEzZk2pc,William Dafoe and Jim Varney would have made great Jokers.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The movie tells you everything already. Society is the trigger for his insanity after his mom dies and no justice was found..... I'm assuming...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger w√ºrde sich im Grabe umdrehen wenn er diesen Grotten schlechten Film sehen w√ºrde
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks ass
-_DJEzZk2pc,Honestly everything released about this movie prior to this trailer seemed tryhard and bad.  This changed my mind.
-_DJEzZk2pc,When will we get a Troy Baker üÉè?
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie sorta weird
-_DJEzZk2pc,That looked boring as fuck.
-_DJEzZk2pc,why he look so much like Ty Burrel
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker: the gamer
-_DJEzZk2pc,...No.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Well this just looks stupid.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This joker i like.

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Argh... Just plain fuckin idiotic.  In the last 20 years  the majority of the movies are shitty Re done,  re makes, re sharted!  And they re not even good lol. I prefer to give a fair chance to any new stories, new ideas and inovation than waste a tiny hour ish to writers/producers who cant even try and destroys what are already (most of the times) timeless masterpieces."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix will do amazing in this
-_DJEzZk2pc,how many joker movies do we need ?

-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks like shit.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don't know...it looks like Ronald McDonald got MAD and is not pleased with the Happy Meal kinda thing.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Um ready to view this one
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath ledger's seat has long been empty.  Someone has to take over right.?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Could this be DC's greatest comeback?
-_DJEzZk2pc,no this isnt going to be an aaction based film is it? Its going to be depressing.
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:51 Bruce Wayne?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I do wanna see this, but I rather have A COMIC BOOK origin story, that is not based on someone elses imagination. I guess folks are sold by film adaptations....and they make money. Eh. This film better ATLEAST have other BATMAN, related characters in the film...or BATMAN in the background."

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joker:hahahahahahah






Maximus: WTF"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh my god
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is there going to be some of his crazy tricks shown or is this just going to be a drama cause this movie looks depressing
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie looks so good! But tbh I kinda wanted to see a Jared Leto Joker movie..
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sit down brie a real actor is coming through
-_DJEzZk2pc,This ones cool but i like the mexican joker from suicide squad too
-_DJEzZk2pc,Lame
-_DJEzZk2pc,This just seems like an filmed expression of sorrow. I would expect more insanity from a true joker. Didnt like the trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This movie, is gonna give all the idiots, who feel like they're important or different, a guideline/ inspiration  on how to live they're life."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this movie based in the DCEU ? I'm from the MCU sooo...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Mr. Phoenix slipped into very big shoes. akwardly they fit like second skin. the production looks awesome.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like a shitty movie.

-_DJEzZk2pc,The slimming  man
-_DJEzZk2pc,He's a liberal democrat cunt :)

-_DJEzZk2pc,"THATS! how Joker has to be!
Not the fucked version before... Ledger did a great job.. before and after him people fucked it up.
Thats the closest to the comics ive seen so far (ledgers beside)"

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Sorry but, no. This doesn't stay true to the comic book source material at all. Looks terrible. So does his makeup. This is the same shit they pulled with Batman vs Superman. It's like they don't respect the source material that made these characters popular to fans in the first place. Not going to waste my money on this one."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Cant wait for Oct.....this looks badass!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,They should do some sort of make up to the teeth.. Make the jokes gums drawn back so more upper teeth are showing same with the lower jaw. The more teeth that show the bigger the smile. HAHAHAHhAhahaha

-_DJEzZk2pc,Where is the action...  bring other joker back from dead. Dark knight.  R.i.p.  best joker ever
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm just glad it's not Jared Leto.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This trailer made me realize that one of the biggest parts of the Joker is something I find very relatable. The idea that you wanna make fun of things and get people to laugh, but you are seemingly too different from them to make them laugh. There's always someone funnier, or more appreciated than you. Joker may be an insane bastard, but he always really wants to make a statement or make people see his messed up form of humor. In a sense, he just wants to be understood, in many scenarios he was in. He hardly ever succeeds, all while other dudes in costumes get all the appreciation, because after all, what he does is hated by people who aren't like him. Now that's something heartbreaking right there if you ask me."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I like Joker, it's one of few characters that tells dark story of society. much more interesting than the shallow happy stories of superheroes"
-_DJEzZk2pc,You heard it hear first......this is going to be garbage üòê
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Can we keep one god damn actor to play the same person. This looks great, but honestly can we keep one actor for the job instead of it changing all the time."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Here‚Äôs your chance DC. And remember, don‚Äôt fuck it up."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The way he runs in the trailer is such a Joker way to run, I love it, it reminds me of how Joker is portrayed in the Arkham games, at least the silly parts of Joker, the movie looks like it will have a lot of serious stuff as well though."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The fact that they used Charlie Chaplin's song ""Smile"" as the underscore, it's like they knew for a fact  that would win me over"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm sooooooo tired of the teal color grading
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wait why are they showing the Jokers origin?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Whats that shit, again ? apparently not a Nolan one."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Every year people are making worst and worst movie. Remember early 2000? Not the best effects but better storys/actors.. now days they only focus on effects
-_DJEzZk2pc,Name of song please üò≠
-_DJEzZk2pc,there is an easter egg at 1:37
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Love comics huge joker fan, I thought heath ledger did an astounding job but I feel like I‚Äôm going to personally relate a lot more to this joker and his performance Jesus Christ he‚Äôs a maniac and I‚Äôm lovin it"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Fingers Crossed we get to see Joaquin Phoenix carry the first Best Actor Award for a comic book film....because this reaps Oscar Worthy material.

Again ‚ÄúHopefully‚Äù we get to see this happen."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ok, I admit it, it looks good üòí"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"this looks so fekkin awful in every single way...  Heath Ledger is dead, leave the Joker alone !"
-_DJEzZk2pc,So sick of seeing your retarded face and fucked up lup stop making movies every single one of them fucking suck dirty dick!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why is Jared Leto not playing Joker he was awesome!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where's Batman???
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gonna got every little edgy cunt quoting this for years to come
-_DJEzZk2pc,Only if Heath Ledger was alive...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Maybe just one action scene at the end so ppl wont think its a non action film which it can't be cuz its a DC film
-_DJEzZk2pc,THIS WILL BE THE BEST DC COMICS MOVIE EVER
-_DJEzZk2pc,Trash
-_DJEzZk2pc,So it's about Joaquin Phoenix getting his ass kicked and laughing about it? LolLolOLoloLoloLoLlOLOLOLolOLOLlolo Ha Ha Ha Ha ha ha HA HAHA
-_DJEzZk2pc,Who else had to watch it twice ???
-_DJEzZk2pc,I already like this Joker much better than Jared Letos
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I jusyt need to see his first smile to be hooked into it.
  Props to Joaquin, he went all the way to embrace the physical look of the Joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,From looking menacing to kind within seconds 0:09 to 0:12. Brilliant
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Gamer rise up
We live in a society
Bottom Text"
-_DJEzZk2pc,FUCK YOU MARVEL DC WINS!!!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix will undoubtedly be dubbed the creepiest Joker to date.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"For everyone who says no one will ever be able to pull the joker role off like Heath Ledger did, I would tend to agree with you.... 

HOWEVER, how many people said that Heath Ledger will never be able to do the joker like Jack Nicholson?..... 

Either way, this looks sick and it‚Äôs going to feel like forever waiting until October to see this....."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh wow. I can‚Äôt wait to see this!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"That‚Äôs cool and all, but man wouldnt William Dafoe make a perfect Joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,The story of Heath Ledger haunts me every time I see a new Joker-related film bein made
-_DJEzZk2pc,Honestly this trailer creeped me out
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:09 He already won an Oscar for that
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This movie is gonna suck. 
Another one of those ""daaark"" and ""deeeeeep"" (instead of ""deeerp"") movies that stupd fans will hype up to the skies and think it's gonna be better than sex, like they did with Suicide Squad. And then, lo and behold: Nothing."
-_DJEzZk2pc,VERONICAAAAAAAAAAAZ
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I really wanted Jared Letto to have his own joker movie he played him beautifuly. however for so many years the story of the joker has been remastered and changes but the way the producers told the story of the joker on suicide squad was amazing down to the weapons he used, the way he was styled and the makeup it was all so perfect .jarred took that and he became to joker it was honestly scary when I watched behind the scenes footage. But this looks dope too I guess."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"smile in the outside, cry in the inside"
-_DJEzZk2pc,i have high hopes for this movie..but making the joker a sympathetic character is just so odd to me
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can‚Äôt wait
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I used to think that my life was a tragedy...now I realize...it's a comedy

Damn son, that's deep af"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is art!! I can tell this one have a great cinematography.
-_DJEzZk2pc,What a trailer. One of the best trailers I have ever seen. I feel sorry for the joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"SLAVE! you will remove your helmet and tell me your name
My name is batman,son of murdered parents,forced to wear bat nipples,and I will have my vengeance,in this movie or the next."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Best trailer I‚Äôve ever seen
-_DJEzZk2pc,Willam Dafoe will be the best joker in DC HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I already feel like this movie will inspire some nut job to kill some people
-_DJEzZk2pc,I wonder if this is the same Joker that Batman will face (if WB get their shit together and figure how they‚Äôre going to make another Batman.)
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Jo Leute guckt mal vorbei. In dem Video zeig ich euch wie ihr euch extrem schnell ein paar Kr√∂ten dazuverdienen k√∂nnt.
https://youtu.be/pke7TIRRx8Y"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wait no batman
-_DJEzZk2pc,I like how he is vulnerable in the beginning of the trailer but by the end he has transformed into more of the confident and menacing badass -that you can't mess with -dark knight joker interpretation
-_DJEzZk2pc,i had(ve) been waiting for this movie for a long time...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like shit.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The movie looks good and interesting but I don‚Äôt think anybody can play the joker better than Heath ledger therefore they should‚Äôve held off on this for a few decades
-_DJEzZk2pc,a deserving joker after Heath! This is going to be awesome
-_DJEzZk2pc,He is the skinny
-_DJEzZk2pc,What the hell happened to using Jared?
-_DJEzZk2pc,wish we saw more of Jared Leto‚Äôs Joker everyone says he was bad but we didn‚Äôt even see that much of him
-_DJEzZk2pc,We do live in a society.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why the fuck is hollywood making another movie about the joker? Why can't hollywood come up with anything original anymore? So annoying
-_DJEzZk2pc,OMG....not again. BOOOORING!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Heath Ledger will be such a hard act to follow, that being said, I'm a gonna watch this lol."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin looks fabulous in costume, appearance, and acting. WOW!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why sooooo Serious???? ahhahahaha (joker laughing in happy face)
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ass
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Meh I get a low effort indie movie feel from this, like it's going to be about being as weird and out there as possible rather then a good movie. Best comparison is motivational growth (which I loved the first watch through but lost me on on the second watch)."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Anyone got the chills with the music?
-_DJEzZk2pc,imagine this movie ending up being a bad movie or a 6 of 10 movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks like art-house CRAP!
-_DJEzZk2pc,GARBAGE
-_DJEzZk2pc,but where is batman
-_DJEzZk2pc,SMILE!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This. Looks. FREAKIN AWESOME!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This actually looks pretty good. The music gets ""darker"" at 2:09 as though that is the actual Joker for the first time."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"looks pretty cool to me
hopefully Joaquin doesn't let the extra exposure from being in a DC movie go to his head"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Got high hopes for this .... joaquin has big shoes to fill in though
-_DJEzZk2pc,"After watching that i just hope one thing , i hope that his outfit will get darker , a little less theatrical , same thing for the make up , i hope he get ride of the red nose ."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Only 6.5million views?? I am sure i have watched it more than this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,First Joker I've ever seen who is actually terrifying.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow I hope DC can make amazing movies from now on. Marvel is going to hell in a hand basket with their SJW/Feminist agenda.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why so serious?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This looks really good, can't wait to watch it! WOW!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,They should have cast the guy who did Green Goblin
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I don't like comics, well at least not super hero comic books (the walking dead comic, I love that). I don't really like super hero movies (I did love into the Spider Verse, that was awesome). I have to say, this looks really cool and interesting. I'd watch this."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Definitely better than Jared Leto..
-_DJEzZk2pc,For the glory of Rome
-_DJEzZk2pc,So glad to see this authentic joker and not Jared Leto's pimp Trap rap artist joker with a lamborghini
-_DJEzZk2pc,Maybe Jared Leto will go crazy in real life watching all the better Joker's
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hope he doesn't get consumed by the darkness of the character...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"after Heath Ledger, for me there isn't any other joker..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,What I don't understand is how Bruce is like an 8 yo in this and he's like 40....that would make him like 60 or something as the Joker b6 the time Bruce is batmaan
-_DJEzZk2pc,This trailer gives me the chills every time... It‚Äôs awesome!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The joker looks classic again hurray
Btw jakuin phonix is amazing sorry I spelled his name wrong"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is it me or are there people out there also not feeling it?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Are you guys serious! He‚Äôs not even joker material  ....won‚Äôt even wait for it to come on demand I‚Äôll wait for HBO!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"They're turning the super villain of the joker into a common person being ""bullied"". Propaganda."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks really great but I still have not doubt that heath ledger will forever be the best joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Bout time DC went back to its roots.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don't know about this üòï
-_DJEzZk2pc,The DCu is really dead after all...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Previous Joker:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxdwZ3IrpRA"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope at the end of the movie were left guessing if this film was his actual backstory or it was just a complete fabrication.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"seeing Todd Phillips as the director, I'm not convinced... hope he proves me wrong"
-_DJEzZk2pc,His laugh at 1:09.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ah man. Be first 1 to see this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin Phoenix... has big shoes to fill after Heath... but so far, is awesome as JOKER. The story looks promising.


BUT IT IS STILL DARK... What is wrong with you DC...? What is wrong with your eyes? Why don't you understand we are tired of this color palette.. Don't ruin Joaquin's hard work with your shitty filters. Please, I beg of you."
-_DJEzZk2pc,oh no look it's not the joker it's joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,nice to have a joker movie without a thot ass Harley quinn
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""Careful optimism arises."""
-_DJEzZk2pc,"My life motto. ""I used to think my life was a tragedy, now I realize it's a comedy"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not better than Heath Ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC at it's best... Best time to stay alive
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heart piercing
-_DJEzZk2pc,A movie showing the villain a protagonist
-_DJEzZk2pc,üóë
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Why a remake? Money grab, I won‚Äôt be watching. You can‚Äôt beat Heath Ledger"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Possibly a actually ‚Äúdark‚Äù movie. Not like no lights but the theme. And pls be good. And i want them to bring back the Gothem feel from Batman Begins.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can't stop watching it ..
-_DJEzZk2pc,"looks like trash, gone downhill"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix is a fucking legend
-_DJEzZk2pc,In my opinion he shoud have less make up
-_DJEzZk2pc,Cant wait!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Garabage
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin wins an Oscar next year for this. This is tour de force!
-_DJEzZk2pc,He ain't no Heath Ledger but not bad
-_DJEzZk2pc,man this joker is gunna be something else i cant wait!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So sick of super hero shit, fucking come up with original stories lazy ass hollywood."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can't wait till he says the n-word
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yea I think I'm gonna PASS on this one
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is why he had embraced this darkness.......2019 Teenagers.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Keith Ledger will never be forgotten
-_DJEzZk2pc,I loved it and still it reminds me heath....!! The king joker..!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,It‚Äòs always the same: they mock em till they go crazy and then they wonder why they snap..
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""we'll just make a new batman/joker movie every 5 years with a different joker. that'll make us millions!"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Man,i m going crazy watching this.already watched it like numerois times n loving it even more every time."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This perfectly captures the tragic nature of Jokers story. This poor bastard desperately needs help and instead Gotham is going to help create its own worst nightmare. It's going to be the Joker we deserve.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Garbage
-_DJEzZk2pc,liberals ruined this one...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This looks crap. It should be called the 'Depresser' not the ""Joker"" nothing Joker-like about him."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can they please pick an actor for Joker already? Every movie there's a new Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Good trailers, but for some reason it brings me to tears."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This might be to crazy for me ü§£
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sad man the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This might not suck actually 
......"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin is starting to look a lot like Phil Dunphy.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now i feel bad for joker a little bit because people are ass holes to him.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Un spin-off sur le Joker? Non mais dites-moi que je r√™ve? Hollywood ne sait plus quoi inventer!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Shit show... will continue to avoid the DC. They've lost their way entirely
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Dang, this is not even the actual movie and I have already re-watched the trailer for so many times! It seriously have the feel and mode of a great origin story in the making. The music score is on point too! #DCclimbingUP"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"wow ,cant wait 4 this movie"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Well, this is doomed to fail..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,For some reason I feel sorry for the dude
-_DJEzZk2pc,I walked in not wanting to like it. Walked out pretty interested. I like that I don't know much about the story.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Boring
-_DJEzZk2pc,Feel like this joker is gonna suckkk üò¨
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is just plain stupid
-_DJEzZk2pc,If the movie takes itself seriously and a well written story with great acting. I would enjoy the movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,This acctually looks good
-_DJEzZk2pc,Slonking...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow nunca voy al cine... pero no se por que esta version del joker merece la pena ir, no me agradan las peliculas de superheroes son muy ruidosas como la porqueria de los avengers ..pero esta tiene algo especial"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I really dig the music but the visuals didn‚Äôt excite me in the least. And the Joker is my favorite DC character by far. Phoenix is a superb actor and we all know he‚Äôs kind of insane in real life, so it‚Äôs seems like it‚Äôd be a fit. But I feel like his insanity comes from a place of a whiny brat who can‚Äôt handle the same Hell we all experience. The Joker from the comics was practically a living demon; comic relief and total murderous anarchic mayhem at the same time. This trailer makes him look more like Norman Bates. We‚Äôll see."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks extraordinary!!   Can't wait until October!!!  HA HA HA  (Joker Laugh)
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Well, this movie looks like crap. Why don't you just stop with remakes, spinoffs and origin movies and just make something original for once in the last 20 years."
-_DJEzZk2pc,¬øBruce Wayne? 1:48
-_DJEzZk2pc,Needs to go straight to Netflix
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The fact that DC is so dark is what makes me like it more then marvel, buh I‚Äôve watched this trailer like 4 times one of my favorites"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Letsss gooooo!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"this is terrifying, because it's true. I hate all these superhero movies flooding the market. But when they stop being well glossed blockbusters from Marvel and they start being actual reflections of the horrors of our society... well that's when I'll start watching again."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I saw skid marks on his underwear.   Very relatable!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,i was there and saw when they filmed a scene from the bronx
-_DJEzZk2pc,Jared Leto has 6.3k accounts and he is propably going to make more
-_DJEzZk2pc,looks like another ‚Äúswing and a miss‚Äù for dc
-_DJEzZk2pc,If he doesn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúWe live in a society‚Äù then what‚Äôs the point
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Climbing the stairs: keeping it sane
descending the stairs: going insane
Nice üëç"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please dont be a failure like jared leto was
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gang Weed
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC's back!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker is really walking the line in this one!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Anybody else besides me can‚Äôt look at a credible Joker since Heath Ledger?  Nobody can ever beat him. They just need to retire the Joker character.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Anyway,my birthday is Oct,and i will love this movie,and will Laugh in the cinema."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow..that was a real good trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,"DC coming back hard..replacing all the bullshit of the past.. Aquaman went good, then joker.. Wonderwoman 2, Shazam.. what's next? can't wait."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"eh, don't think anyone can beat Nolan and Heath's joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Seems that this movie has a lot of influence from ""The Machinist"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,Well look at that. DC shit out another turd.
-_DJEzZk2pc,An epic to-be.
-_DJEzZk2pc,What an amazing actor. No one plays crazy better than Joaquin Phoenix
-_DJEzZk2pc,I trust Joaquin Phoenix. I will watch this
-_DJEzZk2pc,"im sceptical about it, but this could actualy work out"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I cant get iver that kast scen!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Everyone will be standing behind The Joker and burning Batman posters after this movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The music in some parts makes him seem like a hero or antihero with how the swells go. It seems almost happy at times.
-_DJEzZk2pc,It doesn‚Äôt look interesting
-_DJEzZk2pc,pause at 2:16 Have u seen that joker pose before in comics? That is just an awesome movie poster. Chilling and Mysterious.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I didn't see anything that would inspire me to watch it..
-_DJEzZk2pc,I love the trailer the movie gon' be awesome!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where is Badman?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope they change the release date
-_DJEzZk2pc,"i dont understand this, Joker started being red hood and he's not a clown, he's a ""joker"". I really don¬¥t understand nothing..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"What?  No vat of chemicals?  How wrong!  You know what, even though, Tim Burton ignored the comic, at least he put that part in.   Why has that been absent ever since?  Until you incorporate and show that part into the story, as far as I'm concerned it will never be correct!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nope.
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's gonna be a shitty movie I guess.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wanna know how I got these scars?
-_DJEzZk2pc,This does not look good at all
-_DJEzZk2pc,all it takes is just one bad day
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow!  A film about a bad guy's origin.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks horrible
-_DJEzZk2pc,THAT looks sick
-_DJEzZk2pc,He's creepy af
-_DJEzZk2pc,This joker makes ‚Äújoker‚Äù literally look like a clown!üòÇ
-_DJEzZk2pc,He is seen like Russian actor Garkalin.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"0 kills, 0 screamers in this movie.. Bad."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Damn it looks awesome! Please don't be just a hype.
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC fails everytime üò´üò£ but I cannot stop watching this trailer please be the one
-_DJEzZk2pc,At least they didn't have Will Smith play Joker because you bet your ass they would have done that.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don‚Äôt like :(
-_DJEzZk2pc,1.16
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think there is some resemblance with the performance Heath Ledger... could it be that the preparation for the acting was similar to the one that Ledger did?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I smell oscar
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This trailer has to be one of the best I've seen. It reveals enough to pull me in, yet keeps the mystique intact.
The tone feels perfect, as well. 

This could be good. Really good."
-_DJEzZk2pc,most creepy movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,I really liked the music for the trailer. Better than Shazam
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Thanks again everyone
I love you Grimmie

Keep it real"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Either this is the best comic book adaptation ever made or the largest piece of cinematic shit ever put to film (or digital) ever.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is it rated R
-_DJEzZk2pc,New money for old rope.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This better be coming out for Halloween
-_DJEzZk2pc,Lots of awards are waiting......
-_DJEzZk2pc,that kid is Bruce wayne
-_DJEzZk2pc,masterpiece
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger set the bar pretty high as the Joker. I wonder if Joaquin Phoenix has that on his mind.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"From this Trailer üò® This is Awesome üòÅ, i have been Waiting for the Solo movie from the JOKER üòò üëç and Another super Villain üòÄ yes that Will be DEATH STROKE üòò"
-_DJEzZk2pc,well i know him from modern familly and its going to be imposible to watch this without laughing...
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel like heath ledger would be proud
-_DJEzZk2pc,He looks like trevor from gta 5
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I fucking cried
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Yeah this is crap - there really aren‚Äôt that many ‚Äòelite‚Äô class blacks and if u consider the amount that have been put into those positions in the recent cinema, u realise how ludicrous it is! Also that‚Äôs over the too bullshit with those guys bashing the joker on the train - people would realise that the person quite clearly isn‚Äôt the full quid and would call the police or someone, but they certainly wouldn‚Äôt bash him. It‚Äôs just Hollywood as usual- trying desperately to make it unnecessarily entertaining for the sake of that solely ahead of a logical well crafted story. Two examples spring to mind - the movie glory - which was bullshit as no-one was whipped and they added that in for entertainment and the other is blindside - that Sandra bullock (who I hate coz she is always in silly roles like that dim witted show called the box or something like that) plays a character who in reality did pretty much nothing apart from drop the guy off after he told her to stay in the car. It was actually the dad that mainly supported him. Further ruined when they make out he beat up a hardened black gang with guns - he would be dead in a second even if he did manage to beat them. She said shit about the NRA getting back at them - no, you wouldn‚Äôt even get to say that, you‚Äôd just be my bitch‚Äôs breakkie that she‚Äôd gobble up in a heartbeat üíó (I love when my bitch does that) also the NRA r more interested in making us politics more flawed by the minute than helping some idiot Germanic woman (see she isn‚Äôt white as the paint colour is different and she ain‚Äôt cuacasion as she ain‚Äôt Russian - now that Putin is in charge of the caucasus - she‚Äôs a descendant of those from German tribes) 
Also is the black woman supposed to be Harley Quinn? If so that is fucked - y don‚Äôt blacks make their own superhero universe if they want it so bad."
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC just made the right decision recasting.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Newarrrkkkkk
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Basically, this guy tried to smile through his pain until pain made him smile."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Am I the only one who is kinda scared of watching the movie but will still watch it?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"1:08 YES, YES!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is going to be amazing that dude's an awesome actor

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joker does not need an origin story. Any story, no matter how good, is not as good as the mystery that's been built up over the decades. 
Hollywood - 'Screw mystery this is facking bank m8'."
-_DJEzZk2pc,is his body normall?O_O
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks dumb...
-_DJEzZk2pc,IDK why it broke my heart to see him gettin beat by some kids
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I do believe that nothing can replace heath ledger but holy shit this  is a resurrection of heath ledger, literally, just brilliant, can't wait to see the movie, hopefully they stop putting jared leto as joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker? But where are all the jokes?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Another f****** Joker movie when will it end with these goddamn remix just start a new project start something fresh and new nobody cares anymore can anybody really be excited for this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,but do we still live in a society?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I just watched the trailer but still left wondering what its all about?????
-_DJEzZk2pc,"In watching this trailer and all the good movies Joaquin Phoenix has done, I can‚Äôt help but wonder how good River Phoenix would‚Äôve been too."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Low-key sad that the ambiguity of the Joker‚Äôs backstory is gonna be spoiled, low-key also wanted it to include the chemical vats, but HIGH-KEY READY FOR PHOENIX TO DO THAT SHIT."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Damn, since i watched the dark knight, i   just cant fuck with any other Joker roles ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"They are trying so hard with this and its gonna suck. The make up looks horrible and you get the cleft palate fuck head over actor biggest douche to play the main roll. Name 1 thing he's good in? Walk the line fuck no, Gladiator horse shit. We own the night? That movie was shit too. The village? He should've been shot for that. Cut the fan boy/girl garbage out. You're a fan of the character but the actor will let you down. Don't lie to yourselves."
-_DJEzZk2pc,hopefully this isn't one of those movies that starts out insanely slow and he doesn't become joker till the last 30 minutes
-_DJEzZk2pc,Love this so much üò≠üò≠ love back stories. Can't wait
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hopefully he makes heath Ledger proud RIP
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not sure how I feel about this...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"PLOT TWIST






the joker wrote the movie himself, so he made up another past *A G A I N*"
-_DJEzZk2pc,THIS IS LITTERALY A PIECE OF ART. I just dont know how to say it but i feel the movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Bout time they made a origin story
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why does this calm me :/
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquie ganna win osscar this time
-_DJEzZk2pc,this looks so stupid haha
-_DJEzZk2pc,probably the worts trailer ever
-_DJEzZk2pc,this trailer is dark and  sad
-_DJEzZk2pc,die in a fire
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please stop making comic book movies!  They suck!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Welp, it's another choice in Joker's backstory, everyone!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,If DC doesnt mess this one up we might actually get some good films this year!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,jesus christ this trailer gave me chills
-_DJEzZk2pc,I stopped watching all super heroes movies because they all seem the same. Can't wait to see this movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Idk...
-_DJEzZk2pc,LOOKS WACK ASF
-_DJEzZk2pc,He has some big shoes to fill following Heath. This doesn't look serious or intense enough to roll into batman universe. This is like a pedophile joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yesss!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
-_DJEzZk2pc,Penny wise is worried right now.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"80s : throws him to a chemical vat out comes notorious joker.
2019 : throws him to the society out comes the joker even more notorious."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I felt so bad for him when they stole his sign :(
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hmm so this is about the stages on how or why he became the joker. Trailer was sick.. Fuck it looks like a good movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Unpopular Opinion: This Trailer was disappointing
-_DJEzZk2pc,We are all a JOKER!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"THAT'S The Joker. I am extremely excited about this. Fuck off with that Jared Leto stuff, give me more of this."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wack!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"When a single trailor takes you from: Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger are unreplaceable!!!
To: Hmmm, I may have to see this.
Then on to: Oh Robert DeNiro is in this movie? 
...Take my money now!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow, I¬¥m fucking¬†exited. Love Joaquin Phoenix!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sad joke he is a good guy and then he too obssesd to smile
-_DJEzZk2pc,Haven't been excited to watch a movie for a long time. Can't wait for this one.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Stupid
-_DJEzZk2pc,Who is the cutie @ 0:55 ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,No one can play joker role as heather ledge like if you aggre.
-_DJEzZk2pc,And here I was thinking Commodus was deranged...little did I know.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where is batman?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like we have a new Joker! A good one! One Heath would def have given his blessing to!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"ok, iam intrigued"
-_DJEzZk2pc,They better not make him some kind of hero. He's supposed to be evil and insane. This looks more like a revenge movie where he gets back at all the people who hurt him. I hope that's not the case.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Woah is he ok
-_DJEzZk2pc,"New heister/mask update looks awesome

Wait this aint payday 2"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is so sad story
-_DJEzZk2pc,best joker 2008!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yawn..
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Omg can't wait,,,"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix is genuinely crazy so this probably isn‚Äôt even acting for him
-_DJEzZk2pc,I miss heath ledger.. üò≠
-_DJEzZk2pc,please be good
-_DJEzZk2pc,IM EXPECTING TO WATCH THIS MOVIE LATER!! DC DO NOT DISSAPPOINT ME
-_DJEzZk2pc,"WTF...that's a Bond villain, my dudes!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"perfect actor for the role, but didn't they just redo this movie? Fuck seems like they only do remakes now."
-_DJEzZk2pc,At the stroke of 2:10 is the birth of the JOKER!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,So you've basically took everything that goes in a mind of an unsecure overthinking teenager and made a movie from it with a not really good looking actor so the weirdos could relate? What a madlads..
-_DJEzZk2pc,they forgot the white spats.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks amazing n badass perfect actor to play it. face shape !
-_DJEzZk2pc,they always need to find somebody on the brink to play him.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Another dc shit ;)
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can see this movie taking some big bucks at the box office
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks shitt.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Anyone fan of joker ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I m big fan of joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow
-_DJEzZk2pc,The 2nd best joker ever
-_DJEzZk2pc,Jared leto best joker ever
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like an Arthouse movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,No joker laugh 0/10
-_DJEzZk2pc,Trying to get us to sympathise with the joker.... huh
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm not buying what DC are trying to sell me for the joker üÉèüò£
-_DJEzZk2pc,"i dont think i like it, weird."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ladder 49 to this
-_DJEzZk2pc,No one go ever compare to heath ledger as the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,We live in a
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow, he lost alot of weight for this role"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Something strangely alluring about this whole trailer and the upcoming movie. 

It's the 22nd time I'm watching this trailer, and no stopping. Didn't even watch the Avengers trailer, this many times. 

Anybody else?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,After watching this there‚Äôs no doubt Phoenix is perfect for this role.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin reminds me Nicholson from the shining
-_DJEzZk2pc,I will not go for this movie because ite boring
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks atrocious
-_DJEzZk2pc,Well I think you guys keep changing all the characters for this one will be joker and it just doesn‚Äôt look like the original
-_DJEzZk2pc,So they've changed The Joker's history? He wears clown makeup now?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"they should of used his forehead for the smile,..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Old joker is better than this one
-_DJEzZk2pc,Remember when DiCaprio wast set to play the Joker and Scorsese to direct? Wonder what that would have been like
-_DJEzZk2pc,This just looks so fucking good
-_DJEzZk2pc,Marvel is still better
-_DJEzZk2pc,I am excited about movie very much this is the 4th time i came here to re-watch this trailer unfortunately I've to wait till October 2019 üò≠üò≠üò≠
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So, he will kill himself after that movie?
hmmm... okay sorry ...! :\"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not even close
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I wanted to hate in the first seconds.
but damn it looks good cant wait!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Give it a few years. DC will have a new Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix is an awesome actor. Heath Ledger would be proud of this performance. Can't wait to see this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Omg ,that bgm make me feel more"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"1989- Throw him in to acid 
2019- Throw him in to  society"
-_DJEzZk2pc,F*ck yeah this looks GREAT! I think Joaquin Phoenix is the PERFECT choice for the joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks wack batman has always been boring
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think they should just scrap the Expanded Universe stuff and concentrate on making stand-alone movies.
-_DJEzZk2pc,He lookes like roger federer
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Oh, you think society is your ally. But you merely adopted it; I was born in it, moulded by it."
-_DJEzZk2pc,You just you
-_DJEzZk2pc,lets face it .. ever since Jared no joker will ever feel the same.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"well i see now joker has a reason for being evil, wish batman would see that"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm going to see this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:15 when mom says smile for the camera
-_DJEzZk2pc,"*JUST IMAGINE* 

Heath Ledger playing this role."
-_DJEzZk2pc,A more realistic character....
-_DJEzZk2pc,wow i didnt realize that being a clown was that hard
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where is Batman? We need Batman
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Me sitting at home eating a bag of m&ms ""omg I totally feel his pain"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,"wow. chills, very impressive angle and acting for what I could see. Great reference to Heath's performance and looks. Can't wait to see it."
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:51 My theory: *That's Bruce Wayne*
-_DJEzZk2pc,There has been way too many jokers and I'm getting a bit bored of it.  That being said this trailer made the character very relatable and it looks good.  Everyone knows what it feels like to get beat down by life and feel a bit crazy so this should be a good movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Regardless of who the best Joker is, this movie looks like trash and probably will be."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I wish heath ledger was still around to do this
-_DJEzZk2pc,0:40 He definitely got kicked in the balls
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dont like the look of the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sooooo excited üôÉ
-_DJEzZk2pc,I know one thing  for sure...I will watch this trailer at least twice everyday until the 4 of oktober üòç
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I am deeply terrified....
This is going to be great"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh great - another comic book movie.. Hollywood is outta ideas.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I guess society‚Äôs just as toxic as an acid bath ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
-_DJEzZk2pc,i think this guy is going to be a better joker than heath ledger..
-_DJEzZk2pc,Even is name Joaquin sounds like a name of a jester.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ow no ... here we go with the 'who is the best joker' discussion again
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger is smiling in his grave. RIP. This will be awesome!
-_DJEzZk2pc,heath ledger the greatest Joker but I'll give it a try..
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:51 Bruce Wayne
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Chills!Literally chills...JP IS Joker WOW. Ive never thought i would say this after H.L., but good lord this looks f*cking good tough!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Why the hell is all movies violent recently ? Violence is portrayed as something cool. Yeah it seems cool to us primates, but it will wreck the society. It will cause our own downfall."
-_DJEzZk2pc,flop
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hoping that Either batman or spiderman will appear
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Trailer a bit boring (where is the action and batman) comparing it to other joker movies,i don't think that its going to be something special or even close to heath leadger's movie....."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This honestly looks like it could be pretty nice, i love Joaquin as the joker! I never even heard of him as an actor, but he fits the role perfectly. I do think that it may have been a little over the top to make him work as an actual clown, but maybe not."
-_DJEzZk2pc,So if the joker lived in Gotham all his life and became something of a rising celebrity or at least a wana be one then how come everyone didn't know who or where he was from in Dark Knight?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"0:14 the joker walk, fantastic icon"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Rupert pupkin sequel !
-_DJEzZk2pc,Just White people things
-_DJEzZk2pc,He will suicide After the movie (just guessing)
-_DJEzZk2pc,Will watch the first day first show with my friends
-_DJEzZk2pc,"üí∏
    \ (‚Ä¢-‚Ä¢ take my money!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath ledger was the best joker ever. Anything else is a Poundland copy.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks stupid wont be watching this anytime soon for sure.
-_DJEzZk2pc,That‚Äôs the 10th time I‚Äôm watching this
-_DJEzZk2pc,.... looks like a flop...
-_DJEzZk2pc,This could be only Joker yet to challenge Heath Ledger's Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,So joker turned from a psychopathic murder into a depressed psychopath?
-_DJEzZk2pc,this mfs name is Arthur?
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is some BS...smh
-_DJEzZk2pc,They've taken away Jokers true origin. Disappointed
-_DJEzZk2pc,"i will probably never get what is the Joker fuzz all about... he`s a clown and an evil one, no math here for me.. i will not see this movie because i already know that to me it would just be a waste of time."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I can't compare the current rebirth-Joker to this one, but damn this doesn't look like it'll work. If this film ended where it showed Joker discovering the lazerus pit far beneath the batcave that Bruce has yet to find out about then this film could work."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is making me believe that the 3 joker theory is true
-_DJEzZk2pc,October wtf
-_DJEzZk2pc,WTF is this garbage GTFO whoever made this film needs a good kick in.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Rip heath ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,"My body is fucking ready for this...
Bring it on Bitches.........
Aaaaaaaahhhhhhh..
Ah ha.. Haha.. Hahahaha... Eeehaaa haaa.."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"FUCK NOOOOOO
SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
CRISPIN GLOVER"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Great actor, great story, but from this trailer, the same as with all DC movies, for me absolutely no reason to go watch this, it tries to hard."
-_DJEzZk2pc,AA worthy successor to Heath? It looks promising...‚Ä¶.
-_DJEzZk2pc,please be good please be good please be good please be good please be good please be good please be good please be good please be good
-_DJEzZk2pc,bad people made a good man to a terrible man
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix (The Joker) when they think of Joaquin Phoenix they are going to think of (The Joker). Sorry Jack you have just being out played. All hale JOAQUIN PHOENIX (THEEE JOKER)!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I think so many people including me can relate to this joker, looks great"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Although I am interested in the movie. I hope that this is in no way connected to the dark knights joker... The feeling of not knowing where and what the joker was doing before he entered Gotham is one of the reasons why he was so mysterious and feared imo.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Well they ruined joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Love it!...Live it!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks wank
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gamers...
-_DJEzZk2pc,So he became joker after Samantha left him..
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gamers rise up
-_DJEzZk2pc,He probably turned into the joker because of fortnites toxic society
-_DJEzZk2pc,Woah! The thriller is awesome! I feel bad for joker just by watching this thriller. Hope the characters building of joker in the movie will be awesome. But I just wish the make up of joker is more evil rather than clownish ü§° but I Can‚Äôt wait for the movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow I‚Äôve been waiting forever for this joker was driven to insanity by being mistreated
-_DJEzZk2pc,Him the best my favorite actor... I remember him Commodus  in Gladiator!
-_DJEzZk2pc,The Joker card beware don't be a heath
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why do I fell really bad when he gets hit with the sign
-_DJEzZk2pc,I like good old Jack N.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This was the role Phoenix was born to play.  This will be his masterpiece.
-_DJEzZk2pc,*Gamers rise up*
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Maximus: Are you not entertained!?!

Commodus: *smile*"
-_DJEzZk2pc,RISE UP
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ditch the DCEU and let this be the bedrock a new cinematic universe where you make good movies.
-_DJEzZk2pc,But the only thing I can think of is what's bat man doing right now
-_DJEzZk2pc,Someone get that guy a happy meal
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Knowing Joaquin‚Äôs style, this is gonna be deep af"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I dont think that looks good at all tbh
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Can DC just stop making Joker movies/roles in respect for Heath Ledger? 
Really... This is BS
There is nobody to beat Ledger's Joker! NADA."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like a horror flick. lol
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Nah, looks boring to me."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"He‚Äôs is not a meta human 






Anymore"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I almost started crying because of how fucking amazing this looks. Never ever ever felt that way over a trailer. Dude if this movie is as good as the trailer... yikes... masterpiece incoming...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why they always hide his real body derects?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ur confusing us...what really makes him the joker...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Arthur??
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I‚Äòm really exited, but I‚Äôm scure no one can beat Heathüòâ"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hate it when I bully someone and they become a super villain...
-_DJEzZk2pc,That walk down the corridor was iconic.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"the inventor's of ben and jerry's never knew their icecream could give people sugar diseases, so they ate it everyday and got it !!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Woaaa! I felt his pain and sorrow. And Joaquin Phoenix is such a good actor!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Why so serious






It's just a trailer"
-_DJEzZk2pc,this is what dc movie should beÔºÅ
-_DJEzZk2pc,This one look so fucking good!
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:09  this 1 second is already better than all Jared Leto has ever done in his life :)
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think this is definitely going to be the second best joker performance we've seen so far for sure.
-_DJEzZk2pc,My dick still soft . I think bar from ledger was raised soooo high its hard to even get close
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's all about one bad day
-_DJEzZk2pc,"skinny awkward body, the way he walks, his over sized shoes with flared trousers, rake thin intimidating, all thingsthey've deliberately done to make the joker weird. if you meet real weird people there just normal looking. looks great this version but bit of joaquin showing off he can do the skinny thing, dude know one beats bale,,,,machinist."
-_DJEzZk2pc,...This gave me Chills...Please be a Good One...üòñüòñüòñ
-_DJEzZk2pc,Literally the ad to start the video was the trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks so good.  it can make you cry for him.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Should have been Heath..
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why Cameron Monaghan is not the joker ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,@0:16 are these the stairs from exorcist ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Phil Dunphy, Phil ducking Dunphy, I cant unsee it üò≠"
-_DJEzZk2pc,GIve this man a Burger or Hotdog.
-_DJEzZk2pc,he definitely got giant skinny to look more intimating
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is it just me or does this movie seem like something you'd watch at home on Christmas?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Jokers costume looks so shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker Bra
-_DJEzZk2pc,I would refer a younger joker ...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"this has got me looking forward to checking this movie out 
great trailer"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hate how DC keeps changing the origin story
-_DJEzZk2pc,Watched it a few times.......still not excited in the slightest.
-_DJEzZk2pc,What is the song? Fits perfectly with the trailer. Makes me more excited to see this!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks like a fckn masterpiece. Total Killing Joke vibes. BRAVO!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think they are about to make another revolutionary jump in the re-creation of the joker. Joaquin is and amazing an innovative actor when he takes a role to heart.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Don't fuck it up, don't fuck it up, don't fuck it up, don't fuck it up, don't fuck it up, don't fuck it up, don't fuck it up, don't fuck it up, don't fuck it up, don't fuck it up, don't fuck it up, don't fuck it up, don't fuck it up, don't fuck it up, don't fuck it up, don't fuck it up, don't fuck it up, don't fuck it up, don't fuck it up, don't fuck it up."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Look all these sheep hating on Leto for absolutely no reason... Joaquin Phoenix is amazing but letos joker was amazing as well, blame the writers not the actor you dweebs"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This isn‚Äôt how I remember him, I think they want a more realistic approach...I guess, but I like the actors face though"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I had goosebumps seeing how dark Joaquin Phoenix did the joker... WOW. I'm gonna watch this one
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finnaly he is a good guy
-_DJEzZk2pc,God damn i love this dude! Joaquin Phoenix is such a great great actor! He is the movie!  Hope it won't dissapoint!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Amazing look ' joker.I love you
-_DJEzZk2pc,Brilliant! they only showed what society did to piss the joker off but they left all the repercussions for the movie theater. Brilliantly crafted.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This Joker scares me
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nope nope nope nope nope. The joker died with Heath Ledger. This was a big mistake.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks amazing i love these gritty realistic superhero/villain movies ,fuck avengers cgi crap"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"i imt care what people think, there will never, ever be Joker as good as Heath Ledger's"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think I would rather watch paint dry
-_DJEzZk2pc,Confirmed Flop incoming
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:09 holy moly I luv it
-_DJEzZk2pc,OMG
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I relate 2 the joker, i'm glad i haven't lost my mind tho."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Seriously this boring character again?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is disappointing, in batman there was a totally different joker.
Or am I wrong?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Don‚Äôt know why people are doing comparisons to HL joker. They‚Äôre completely different and that‚Äôs obvious from this trailer. This joker is showing how his perception of life is challenged by the real world and that‚Äôs what ‚Äúsends him insane‚Äù. The scary thing about this joker is we don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs thinking until it‚Äôs revealed by the characters actions. Like others have also said this is going to be a much darker and sinister version of the joker and the movie is going to be moving towards more of a thriller. Ledgers joker was his own and a very talented portrayal of the joker but was another antagonist for batman to fight and his moments were gold but few and far between (in a way). I guess the only way for me to be able to describe what I‚Äôm thinking is that JFs joker is going to be a twisted sinister IT type and HLs joker was a twisted criminal/don.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can't wait to watch this happy movie!! üòÄ
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""THIS FALL""....
WAS ON A TRAIN!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks interesting!
-_DJEzZk2pc,this wont be beter than the joker from the dark night
-_DJEzZk2pc,Movies in 2019 LUL
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC... no way lol this looks like it could be watchable
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin not winning an Oscar in this movie is a Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I prefer cartoon network
-_DJEzZk2pc,"More excited for this than Endgame...don't be triggered, I'm still excited for Endgame."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I prefer cartoon network
-_DJEzZk2pc,Super hyped for this. The story of a compelling character development in who he came to be. To be understand is to experience. How can one describe and understand the taste of an apple if he never had eaten one. Surely no one could never have understood you for you if they never have lived your life in your shoes.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think this movie will be good I do have to feel bad for the new actor because he has to fill in Heath ledgers shoes. The fact that he has about the same facial structure is a good start the only thing I really want from this new joker is insanity I want it pushed to the max I'm talking burning piles of money and blowing up hospitals insane I hope they can do that if not I don't know if this will be good but like I said with spiderman homecoming no one will replace Toby Mcguire and the same goes for Heath ledger they will always be the best actors for their roles.
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC best character after Lobo
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath ledger. Best joker ever.
-_DJEzZk2pc,lol wut he got beat up by white guys in the subway??
-_DJEzZk2pc,GO JOAQUIN PHOENIX GO GO. YOU JUST FIT WITH JOKER
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie will be released in Joktober 2019
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So ... the evil one , in this movie .... will be Batman ?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,this is the worst trailer DC is losing value
-_DJEzZk2pc,I miss the old joker...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Too artsy. By Hollywood for Hollywood and nobody else. Where‚Äôs the depravity..? Guy looks like he‚Äôs about to break into a tap dance across the city
-_DJEzZk2pc,Society
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fucking A
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath ledger played the best joker of all time maybe this guy will come in second
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It would be one of the best drama movies of all time if this had nothing to do with Batman or Gotham but was simply about a guy who lived this life and got picked on, and eventually came to an end."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is of my favour movie block buster i was waiting for it for 3 years and now its show time üî•üî•üí•üí•
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's a shame that Heath Ledger wasn't still with us to play this role. A film with him as lead in the origin story would've been breathtaking
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Oh DC, buy me dinner first oh my"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I would rather watch youtube rewind
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath ledger Fans like hear üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòòüòòüòò
-_DJEzZk2pc,Idk dawwggg....
-_DJEzZk2pc,Its about goddamn time!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie looks fuckin terrible
-_DJEzZk2pc,"These fucken fast food workers with no other talent or experience saying oh a masterpiece, yeah piece of shit üòÇüòÖüòÖüòÖ"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I had to watch it without actually watching it..... So like out of the corner of my eye........how am I supposed to watch the movie?
Oh great it's coming out in my birth month"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This look fucken lame. Joker shows no weak pussy sad Sapp Bs story
-_DJEzZk2pc,About time
-_DJEzZk2pc,That is not joker this is shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not really sure what the motive of the Joker is in this trailer?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Damn I‚Äôm sorry joker üò¢
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yes!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Love to see this new joker this movie looks so interesting
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think he's got the right face for the Jocker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Y so serious hahahhhhahhahhahhahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahhhhhahahaahahhaaahaahagaghahahahaggagahgaghahahahahahhahahahahhhhhah
-_DJEzZk2pc,holy shit this looks like it suck so much balls.... one of the things with the joker is the mystery of what really fucked him up. and here it is a drama of the joker so you can feel sympathy towards him.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Damn it where‚Äôs Ben Affleck when you need him
-_DJEzZk2pc,RISE UP
-_DJEzZk2pc,WEüëèLIVEüëèINüëèAüëèSOCIETYüëè
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I hope an awesome movie and not  a bad chain of awesome scenes, which try to let you feel with the poor misunderstood Joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Typical sellouts everywhere u go.

Before this movie you were 'No one ever is going to replace Heath's Joker' First movie about actual joker after Heath's death,you think its better than H.L's ...

Movie is DRAMA about mentally ill person who calls himself Joker.You might as well watch age of adaline if you want drama."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Damn, now this looks like it might be kick arse!!! Not like that Capt Marvel horse shit....."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Love Phoenix but the joker died with Ledger who played joker for life and beyond.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like garbage
-_DJEzZk2pc,What‚Äôs paper boi doing here
-_DJEzZk2pc,Imagine I did the theme song for the joker movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin aging like a fiiine wiiine, freekin awwwwesuuuum"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Too remedial. Looks like the 70s. Does Hollywood have anything intelligent to communicate from a head or a spoil?  Listen to my segment ""The Wizard of Oz and WWII, Psychoanalytics vrs Public Hospital"" on Anchor: https://anchor.fm/dana-edwards/episodes/Wizard-of-OZ-and-WWII--Psychoanalytics-vrs-Public-Hospital-e296vd/The-Wizard-of-Oz-and-WWII--Psychoanalytics-vrs-Public-Hospital-a5etni"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"What is this is piece shit? It‚Äôs a humiliation to Christopher Nolan‚Äôs movie The Dark Knight and Heath Ledger‚Äôs performance of playing the Joker. Heath was the best joker, even Jack Nicholson admitted and he is a legend."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can‚Äôt even count how many times I‚Äôve watched this
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oohh ahh i miss New Yorküò≠
-_DJEzZk2pc,This guy might possibly out rank Heath Ledger as the joker. HEATH FUCKING LEDGER.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Anyone would be better than Jared Leto 
Anyone"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel like this DC movie will focus on reality and less alien or god related stuff. If Batman‚Äôs gonna show up fine he‚Äôs human too. I think this film will show what life can truly mean for a clown.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gayyyyyyy
-_DJEzZk2pc,I came here to watch the joker trailer... The ad was a trailer for the joker... Someone's trolling me
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ohhh was to society that made the Joker? It‚Äôs societys fault maaaaaannnnnn. He‚Äôs a product of America Maaaannnnnn. That dumb forced laugh. Look at me I‚Äôm such a crazy guy laugh. Dancing around in the streets with all the cliched clown stuff. Big smiles, dumb wigs, weird guy dancing around on his own. This is going to stink. Joaquin Phoenix is fucking terrible."
-_DJEzZk2pc,this will either be perfect film or total bullshit
-_DJEzZk2pc,Damn he got skinny af
-_DJEzZk2pc,"We need a few of these walking around the Islamic neighborhoods, and heaps more let loose in Arabic countries."
-_DJEzZk2pc,So this is basically an anti bullying campaign?
-_DJEzZk2pc,@1:33 felt very emotional and sad when he was running like that..
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Jared Leto who???! People expect you to behave as if u don‚Äôt suffer with mental illness, relatable üò¢. I use to think my life was a tragedy, now i know, it‚Äôs a comedy"
-_DJEzZk2pc,—Ö—É–µ—Ç–∞ –¥–∏–∫–∞—è –∫–∞–∫–∞—è —Ç–æ
-_DJEzZk2pc,This just might save DCEU
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger would have been so pround to see thisüò¢üò¢üò≠
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Heath Ledger has been my benchmark for acting since 2008. When I see movies coming with lead roles of people I‚Äôm like ‚Äúhim/her?? Seriously??!‚Äù *because* of HL‚Äôs Joker I give that person the benefit of the doubt on whatever role they‚Äôve been casted for. So, at least for me, these are massive shoes to fill. I wish JP the best of luck. Totally gunna go see it."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This could actually work really well as the DC direction. Goofy explody superhero movies for marvel, gritty dark superhero movies for DC. Less overlap, less competition because people go to different films to see different things. 
Assuming they can make actually good movies that is."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I love this dark Joker movie, its going to be awesome."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Another legend after heath...
-_DJEzZk2pc,I... don't think he's acting....
-_DJEzZk2pc,is it rated R
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks wack
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks like it's the one of the worst films ever
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why so serious?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Favourite trailer that I can remember
-_DJEzZk2pc,Brilliant how he can animate the lower part of his face whilst keeping cold emotionless eyes. You just know he's going to put his heart and soul into this role. Looking forward to it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Tbh i didnt think you were gonna be a good joker but this trailer changes my mind cant wait to see it
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yooo! This is what mankind has been waiting for!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I hate how they have yet again, changed the jokers back story üòÇ"
-_DJEzZk2pc,cant help but think this will be fucking awful
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow its going to flop big time, wrong person to play the joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Such a horrible music score! Hans where are you buddy???
-_DJEzZk2pc,"why did I read ""don't"" as ""donut""? 2:26"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks incredibly depressive and negative.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this the guy that played as Johnny cash?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Holy God. This is glorious. Phoenix, an all time great actor is probably 2nd to D.D. Lewis when it comes to actor commitment and in picking great films to star in. That soft, meek laugh at bar is creepy. I know Joaquin wants this one off only as character study like Taxi Driver and King of Comedy, but would it be great if we get this equation in the future?--J. Phoenix + Ben Affleck +  Todd Phillips + Scott Silver + Martin Scorsese + as a Detective Mystery thriller Crime Drama film=A W E S O M E"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"‚ÄúWhat kind of coward hides behind a mask‚Äù that sounds like the guy who voiced Batman the Animated series cartoon. 

I hope so. This is going to make me trip. Hearing Batman‚Äôs voice finally after Chris Bale and Ben Afflek 

ü§Øü§¨"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I actually felt sorry..
-_DJEzZk2pc,Was super skeptical but wow this trailer is cut well. I‚Äôm actually interested
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not Sold...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"We should make a petition so that this joker says ""we live in a society"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm chilled
-_DJEzZk2pc,am I the only one that has seen this 25 times?
-_DJEzZk2pc,The Suicide Squad Joker is the Walmart version compared to this unique creation
-_DJEzZk2pc,2019 everybody?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"We need a few of these walking around the Islamic neighborhoods, and heaps more let loose in Arabic countries."
-_DJEzZk2pc,amirite?!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please don‚Äôt fuck up this movie DC this is literally your last chance of changing your reputation
-_DJEzZk2pc,Name of song anyone
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie suck
-_DJEzZk2pc,wow. i cant remember the last time i was excited for any movie... this however looks awesome
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally gamers get their representation
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Is it me or is Joaquin way better than Jared, the backstory makes me feel way more sympathetic towards the joker and I don‚Äôt know how to feel about that tbh"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Kinda gives me goosebumps
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks kinda weak
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So Ledger's Joker was so prolific that from now on Joker will sound and have the same hairstyle as heath did...well, even tho Leto gets alot of crap for his version, I liked that his Joker at least had his own look."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Shits gonna suck, I'm calling it now."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I keep rewatching this trailer because it's so awesome.


Can't wait until October!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,My heart sank when I saw the joker crying after those dickheads stole his sign :(
-_DJEzZk2pc,I mean I still like the guy from suicide squad the best but he has a good voice for it I guess
-_DJEzZk2pc,What is this? Like our 7th joker?
-_DJEzZk2pc,This gonna be the best DC movie yet
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can't wait
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is one of those classics, boring for the first hour and a half and good for the last 20 minutes."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôm ready
-_DJEzZk2pc,Am I the only one who thinks that this movie will suck balls?...I'm just very concerned but then again after the latest DCMU failures I'm very anxious
-_DJEzZk2pc,wow...really interesting
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker is my hero!
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:51 Young Bruce Wayne alert!
-_DJEzZk2pc,*HELL YEAH*
-_DJEzZk2pc,Tell me why I just related to the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Original: throw him into a vat


New joker: throw him into society"
-_DJEzZk2pc,DAMN I AM HYPE IN THIS MOTHERFCKING MOVIE
-_DJEzZk2pc,More like action movie than Hero movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Every villain is once a good person... With a terrible past.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker makes to much jokes in october
-_DJEzZk2pc,"C

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Stop saying the Joker only became the Joker from acid in the 1989 version. Even then, he was poisoned by society before that happened."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin Phoenix is cool and all, and I believe he'll do justice to the role,  but he's no Heath Ledger."

Like this please"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If the movie is as good as this trailer, then Joaquin Phoenix will have his name added to the list of legendary portrayals of the Clown Prince of Crime."
-_DJEzZk2pc,*Jered leto left the chat*
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:51 Bruce wayne?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow a superhero movie that isn't just another mindless action flick... haven't seen this since the Christian bale batmans.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm sorry to have to say that I'm not impressed with this.  He doesn't even look like the Joker, just another clown.  He doesn't show any of the Joker's mannerisms in the trailer, and that's detrimental to the movie's release.  If it doesn't look like the Joker, or sound like the Joker, then it *isn't* the Joker, and much fewer people will watch.  I'd rather have Mark Hamill doing the live-acting himself using his Joker voice than see this as it is.  I didn't like the promo photos then, and I like this trailer even less."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I believe this will not only be a good movie but a masterpiece.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Another joke for the Joker:
Why did the clown cross the street?
To get hit in the face with his own sign"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks depressing and tragic af... Looks great!
-_DJEzZk2pc,me da tristeza ver a ese payasito en el suelo toc√°ndose las bolas :'v
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks actually amazing
-_DJEzZk2pc,Won't judge it till I've seen it
-_DJEzZk2pc,Trash
-_DJEzZk2pc,Use the Gotham joker please
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It looks like its either going to be amazing, or fall flat on its face.  I want it to be amazing. Heath Ledger just made it a tough character to bring back."
-_DJEzZk2pc,0:40 *Is it just me...or is it getting crazier out there?*
-_DJEzZk2pc,Here comes a clown crisis...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So, Loretta stinson is the mom of the Joker... 

This movie will be legend.. 
Wait for it..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Imagine heath ledger tho üôèüèºüôèüèºüôèüèºüî•
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I love MR phoenix for sure but this thing looks crap, im sorry"
-_DJEzZk2pc,They filmed this in Newark New Jersey
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can't stop waching this trailer:)
-_DJEzZk2pc,‚ÄúI used to think that my life was a tragedy. But now I realize..... it‚Äôs a comedy.‚Äù That‚Äôs life baby. Life‚Äôs a laugh and you‚Äôre always the clown.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Darkman 4: I want to kill Dark men.
-_DJEzZk2pc,He dies before saying the n word.
-_DJEzZk2pc,gotham series joker will be best
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is gonna rule
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm here for all of this... every part of this. I'm here for it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Has no one learned the lesson from this role. You do not hire method actors for this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I hope Phoenix is the Joker in the Suicide Squad reboot. With Margot Robbie still as Quinn, that would be great"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Sorry Heath. may your soul rest in peace. but we found the ""JOKER"" in Joaquin <3"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks stupid and boring
-_DJEzZk2pc,Aight dc you have my interest
-_DJEzZk2pc,im not convinced... he looks ok... now act
-_DJEzZk2pc,Got bored sitting thru the trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks so bad
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's a cool look but stupid storyline from the way it looks joker needs batman to keep its storyline right
-_DJEzZk2pc,He was suppose to play in the dark knight as joker... Really
-_DJEzZk2pc,That walk üëå
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel like we should never further the story. Lets just keep remaking the origin stories. Wouldn't that be cool?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think this is going to be a masterpiece
-_DJEzZk2pc,EPIC
-_DJEzZk2pc,I liked heath ledger better
-_DJEzZk2pc,What the hell I'm confused didnt his dad abuse him and killed his mom where did this story line come from and how does this one play into batman because he was a street thug not a street Clown on the corner so are we not doing the Wayne family being killed by him before he was the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,anyone else notice paper boi??
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Please NO! BOO!!! I hate how warner brothers keep remaking these characters with different actors and ruin the franchise. üò°

Disney please make an offer to warner brothers in an effort to save the once great franchise!!
#abetterreboot"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm really impressed with the trailer, you feel empathy for him already  just by watching the trailer."
-_DJEzZk2pc,So does he blow shit up or something?? We need the old joker back üò°üò°üò°
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don‚Äôt like the new Joker..
-_DJEzZk2pc,This joker is just plain creepy...Heath Ledgers was criminally perfect but this one seems like one you'll more likely encounter in real life
-_DJEzZk2pc,"A movie from gamers, by gamers, for gamers. 

#gamersriseup"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Must be a lot of pressure to play the Joker after Heath Ledger did a perfect job of it. Kind of weird that they keep re doing the character though.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Alot to live up to, potentially alot withheld in the teaser.  I feel this movie will not only be amazingly sadistic, but fear it may end in a tragic yet unforgettable conclusion."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wasnt the jokers smile cut up by his father when he was a child ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I went Bat $hit crazy over this trailer!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I really hope this is good
-_DJEzZk2pc,That‚Äôs an entrance 2:10
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Come on DC, We can make it."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I fell asleep just watching this boring ass trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,Most you youngins dont even remember Heath. No one will ever be a better joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Laaaaaaaaaaa!me
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Jerome from the show Gotham is definitely better joker, but tjey ducked that up too by making his twin the joker. So by default Heath Ledger was the best Joker thus far.  This movie looks interesting and worth watching, but doesn't look too authentic take for Joker role."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"*Next trailer,*
*Batman married Joker!*"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don‚Äôt like 90% of the movies made after 2005 but this trailer looks very promising.
-_DJEzZk2pc,johnny cash as the joker tf?
-_DJEzZk2pc,doesnt look dark enough.... its looking like another failed super hero comedy movie...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nope.
-_DJEzZk2pc,this movie us aside from the dccu right??? pls say it is
-_DJEzZk2pc,Does anyone know name of music at the end
-_DJEzZk2pc,No thanks. No interest in putting money into that christian weirdos pocket.
-_DJEzZk2pc,https://youtu.be/T_Lo695VJKU
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wtf happened to the og joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,SMILEEEEE THOUGH YOUR HART IS ACHING SMILE EVEN TOUGH HET ITS BREAKING
-_DJEzZk2pc,He very slim.
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's brutal film.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"1:08 that laugh tho


give me chills"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Now I'm curious about the woman he is with in presumably his home, is that his mother he is talking about or possibly his wife like in the Killing Joke

And thinking on it more, the way that this origin story of the Joker seems to have gained a following, people backing him most likely now because of crime mobs but the people itself, I feel like it'll show how the Joker was like Batman being a so called vigilante the police were after but instead of fighting the criminals, he fights the injustice he sees in the government of Gotham as batman sees in the criminal world"
-_DJEzZk2pc,save us mark hammil
-_DJEzZk2pc,Only good DC product
-_DJEzZk2pc,Too dark for me. Dark Knight actually gave me a nightmare.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel sad and i watched it 2 3 times a day since it released... Tell me i m normal
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel sad and i watched it 2 3 times a day since it released... Tell me i m normal
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:08 only part of the trailer i dont like
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks lame. Stop, just stop with these terrible movies"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow I can't wait for the seventh take on the joker in the last 10 years. How refreshing and original.
-_DJEzZk2pc,So is this suppose to be the growth of the joker and how he came about?
-_DJEzZk2pc,0:30 - this made my heart ache.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Damn this looks good!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think Heath Ledger's Joker was the best.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Screw Endgame, im putting my money on this!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks terrible
-_DJEzZk2pc,Jim carrey would of killed this
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nothing excites me about this trailer. Looks ok.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"DC could rebuild their cinematic universe around the joker, DC has always had better villains because they are darker, not let's hope they build on this and don't fuck it up, I would literally introduce a couple more DC villains before a superhero is introduced"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"DC better not fuck this up if they do im done with them. If they can fuck up a Joker movie they can fuck up anything. Stick to animation, thats your thing."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow , this is hot"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Funny how cynicism works when the worst in our lives comes out
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don‚Äôt think this is Batman joker. I think it‚Äôs the beginning of the symbol
-_DJEzZk2pc,WE LIVE
-_DJEzZk2pc,"we gotta remember there's a lot of parallel stories around the comic books, so the ""peter got bitten so he's spiderman"" way to look at the movie can ruin it."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"One word...""Trash"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath ledger's joker was amazing it's hard to see anyone else playing joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker > Avengers
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks awful tbh
-_DJEzZk2pc,"judging by the trailer  i feel like the writers let the pressure get to them to sell another big hit and went too big with their writing again, which will result in too much over the top nonsense causing the story line to be utterly lacking."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm going to take it that this joker doesn't clown around?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joker has no true origin, it's on purpose as Joker could be anyone...all it takes is ONE BAD DAY"
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:11 that part really cut deep
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can someone tell me the jist the point to this movie is?
-_DJEzZk2pc,No Batman? Who is he going up against? And we'll we see those crazy gadgets he uses? Stay tuned. Same Joker time same Joker channel.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Brilliant
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The joker Only deserves the best actors.   Jared Leto want not the best joker, but he is one helluva actor.  It would be disrespectful to cast a shit actor as the joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Shit
Looks
üóë"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wonder what Ledger would have thought of this... nobody will ever beat his Joker though, he was the ultimate Joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nope
-_DJEzZk2pc,HAHAHAHA YES!!! I LOVE HIS
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Thumbs down, this is not the joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Am I the only one that thinks this looks too heavy?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think Juaquin Pheonix will do an amazing job but Heath Ledger‚Äôs performance is one of the best i‚Äôve see to this day.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hopefully he survives it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"oh look, actual cinema. It probably wont do well but will be an amazing movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Anyone else read Rage by Stephen King? If so I think Charlie becomes the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ok no one will ever top Heath ledgers joker in my eyes. So we shall see what Mr. Phoenix can deliver to this role. I think he is defiantly a great actor but you never know till you see it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Aesthetic Joker Musical? And I keep replaying this fantastic trailer.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This joker not made from society, he's represent of society nowadays."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Seems like a ‚Äúpsycho‚Äù type thing with his mom or I hope it is
-_DJEzZk2pc,Thank god they YEETED Suicide Squad Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"although they picked a great actor for the role, i think the writer has botched the story and ruined another good villain. stick to the origin screw society"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Considering Heath Ledger‚Äôs death and Jack Nicholson‚Äôs warnings about playing this role... is anyone else concerned for Joaquin Phoenix‚Äôs mental & emotional well-being?
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is triggering so many alt left angry fucks ...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ok..that font like the last of us
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is just refreshing. A comic book - based movie trailer that feels more like an indie drama trailer. Actually a very beautiful one
-_DJEzZk2pc,I almost cried at his story
-_DJEzZk2pc,Johaquim phoenix‚≠êüíéüåπüíö
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is the only dc movie id watch
-_DJEzZk2pc,Man that movie looks like it‚Äôs gonna suck
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joker is just a man who come form a low level class of the society. Forced to put on a happy face, represent the ugly side of all human."
-_DJEzZk2pc,What!?!?! they're not going to make Joker a female?
-_DJEzZk2pc,That's deep
-_DJEzZk2pc,We need Christian Bale back on !!! #BaleXpheonix
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hahahahaha they really are milking every character now lmaooooo this movie is gonna do awful at the BO
-_DJEzZk2pc,Stupid
-_DJEzZk2pc,I prefer Heath Ledger to be honest
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:08 doctor doofenshmirtz
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Well, here it is the next Oscar winner."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Best joker of all time
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Pheonix is such a great Actor he was great in that Johnny Cash movie and in Inglorious Bastards and he s even better in this One Finally a worthy Joker again after Hedge Ledger.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks genuinely brilliant. Like a twisted take on The King of Comedy.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This made me cry more than feel creeped the fuck out
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm a huge joker fan. I saw all of the movies. This one is definitely gonna make me cry tbh. Because people can relate to this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,You can already tell this movie misses the point of the joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Lol..
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I like that actor 
But not sure more then Jared letto 
Jared is my fav"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I am so mad that they fucked the story of his child hood
-_DJEzZk2pc,Pass
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's DC don't expect too much guys. I think it's gonna be a average movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks kinda boring
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I just realized, the joker didn't make him the way he is... Gotham made him the way he is"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Too many versions of JoKers movies i can't choose one!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Remove all the silly ""Batman""  stuff and you  might  have  a good movie here."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks awesome! I can‚Äôt wait to see this new take on the joker, and I‚Äôm ultra enthused to be seeing good dc movies again."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm just psyched to see the role Marc Maron plays in this flick.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I am so sick of the Joker, but this looks intriguing."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Honestly, this trailer ruined my expectations for the movie, it was pretty trash, and I had been so hyped all along ever since the news first broke of Joaquin playing him, and since the first pictures of him as the Joker came out.


This is good though, I'd rather go in the movie with shitty expectations and come out blown away, than to be overly hyped by a trailer and then be disappointed with the movie.


Please dont fuck this up DC."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Marvel doesn't have this kind of story. They need the CGI and cool soundtracks.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The laugh is great but the makeup kind of throws me off, i guess im so used to dark knight joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Actually looks incredible very similar to heath ledgers joker but I believe it may even be better
-_DJEzZk2pc,I really don'y like giving him a name its the joker hes crazy and we don't know who he is
-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôm happy DC is embracing the darkness of the Joker. This looks awesome.
-_DJEzZk2pc,That ain't Gotham that's The B.X. lol .#TheStairs
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fuck'n stoked.
-_DJEzZk2pc,–ü–æ-–º–æ–µ–º—É —à–ª—è–ø–∞
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Well, the entity called ""Joker"" seems strong. 
It killed Heath Ledger. As Jack Nicholson said after Ledger's death: 
""I warned him about that role""
Let's hope Phoenix knows his way out of this ""pact"" like Nicholson did."
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC stepping their game up. Doom patrol and young justice and now this and Shazam
-_DJEzZk2pc,So we just gonna let Johnny Cash be the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ughh can't wait
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please dc make me this movie good
-_DJEzZk2pc,honestly waiting so long for this movie or any movie not about heroes
-_DJEzZk2pc,Seems lame
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks dark and twisted.and fkn stupid..
-_DJEzZk2pc,"i thought it was Ty Burrel, but nope.. So look alike lol"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why so serious?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Watched this trailer like a 100 times
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks so dumb
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where are the scares that he got when he was a boy
-_DJEzZk2pc,üëéüèΩ
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:08 Jimmy Carr is the new Joker?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Good old drama. Actors, camera and lights."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks ass
-_DJEzZk2pc,Seems  weak  an watered down for a back story
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:51 I heard that the boy was Bruce Wayne..seems that they are destined to be arch enemies since then
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I like him as an actor, but this completely tries to make the joker anything but the totally deranged serial killer and psychopath that he is. The idea of trying to make it more of a theater performance theme rather than comedic maniac. The movie will be a flop. Hollywood is a disaster this decade."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"what in the fucking world is this piece of shit??? this looks like a french film with some retarded european cinema gone wrong! BADLY WRONG! i would want to see LETO as joker instead of this piece of garbage. and that is already low. i wouldnt watch it even if its free to watch. congratulations ""joker"" you won THE WORST JOKER IN HISTORY, BY A LOOONG SHOT."
-_DJEzZk2pc,No one is born evil
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nah this looks so good
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin : I'm the jokerü§°
Heath : hold my pencil







üò≥üò¢üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
If Heath was alive
RIP Heath Ledger 
Best joker we can ever see"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Never liked Joaquin Phoenix
-_DJEzZk2pc,Likely the strangest trailer we have ever seen.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"what I love about it is they don't once show the violence he's done to other people, only others to him, and that build up the tension so high it's going to burst when we walk into the theater.hahahahaaahhahahahahhahaha"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope the movie has a good soundtrack
-_DJEzZk2pc,Man this looks terrible.. maybe its because I have a an image of what and who Joker is and how he came to be and this doesnt match.. I dont know why they would try to re-invent the wheel.. just make a new character if that what you want. Love the trailer if this was for a different character.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Eh
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Merryl, Kill the Batman"
-_DJEzZk2pc,For me Robert Knepper would have play the best joker character
-_DJEzZk2pc,"When I heard about this movie, I was very skeptical that it would work. Part of the Jokers appeal was that he had no cannon origin story and that he was mysterious. But this looks like it might be good. Might at least be better than that Venom movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""Get a load of this society"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,Kind of eerie that this was uploaded a day before Heath Ledger's birthday.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow, this trailer was surprisingly captivating. I‚Äôm definitely going to watch this."
-_DJEzZk2pc,SO DAMN HYPEDDDDDDD CANNOT WAIT!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Could be really good or could be a dud.
-_DJEzZk2pc,perfect
-_DJEzZk2pc,holly shit! i love this!!! come on DC!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is there a thumb on the side button I can press?
-_DJEzZk2pc,the kid @ 1:52 = Bruce Wayne
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ok so that's Romero, Nicholson, Ledger, Leto, and now Phoenix.........Hollywood just can't stop selling out can they, greedy parasites."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"like pac said nevermind they enjoy the pnis, totally, im beinn serious right now.. ha fools wouldn't evn know how to handle teleknese .."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why so serious
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nobody beats heath ledger as the joker... NOBODY!! Irreplaceable. But looks not bad
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:30 is where you get goosebumps.‚ù§üî•
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If I see a clown-dressed guy laughing as a maniac, the least thing i'd do is getting closer to him"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can we just let this lame character die? The whole modern Batman universe should just go away.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"1:20 is very odd, 3 white guys in suits beating up a clown on the subway? Let‚Äôs be realistic we all know who‚Äôs doing the violence on the subway"
-_DJEzZk2pc,He looks like a demented James Taylor..
-_DJEzZk2pc,?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Q movie tan basura!! O sera solo el tr√°iler basura!? No se ve ni como psic√≥pata se ve como todo un Don Pendejo
-_DJEzZk2pc,uhhh thought he had scars around his lips. Didn't his dad cut the corner oh his mouths with a knife?
-_DJEzZk2pc,bibimos en un asaito
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks rad as all hell!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So many faces.
So many smiles.
All the same."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Anything this man is in is always gold
-_DJEzZk2pc,"TBH, DC needs to get its crap together. they've got a new actor for every role in every other movie lol"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why are there so many Jokers?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks boring as fuck.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Chosen actor, tone, music, atmosphere and setting seem great...praying for a good script please don't f@#k this up."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix seems like a great actor ..*Remembers he's Commodus* ... Fuck him üò†
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow DC is really turning around
-_DJEzZk2pc,FUCKING SUCK BIG DICK! FUCOJFAEWEINHGFWERNFFFFFUCK!
-_DJEzZk2pc,wE LiVE iN A SocIeTY
-_DJEzZk2pc,But where are his scars?
-_DJEzZk2pc,The joker is now scared of Joaquin
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I still think that (Heath Ledger) was the best Joker ever !! 
i still get sad when I watch the 
Dark Night 

Also the best part about what makes the Joker such a wonderful villain was the fact that he was a crazy psychopath with no true Origin story 

he was wild and crazy but the fact that he had no background is what made him so interesting..   giving a reasoning to his insanity makes the character feel less evil. 

problem with DC movies now is that they are making the villains seem like hero‚Äôs or ‚ÄúAnti-hero‚Äôs‚Äù but then making then seem more likable 

This movie is going to be garbage and you KNOW it... 
but let‚Äôs be honest 
I‚Äôm sure people will still pay to see this"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""One bad day"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,"No, I hate this Joker worst joker ever"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks gay
-_DJEzZk2pc,Kraft by you guys quite the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Get load of this society
-_DJEzZk2pc,OHHH MY GOD!!! IF I SEE ANOTHER I-F***ING-FOOD PROPAGANDA I'M GOING TO KILL SOMEONE!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I watch this everyday like if it were my religion
-_DJEzZk2pc,Strangers in the night ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ugh, spelling, never the less evil he‚Äôll yon to be dealt with"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Bring your Johnny cash to the joker. Pretty awesome character his Diane must be fresh, love hate , and the finished product. An abominashion"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Everyone is already getting their hopes up way too high. Batman v superman had an awesome looking trailer too, and we all know how that turned out. They better not be giving joker the venom treatment of making him a secret good guy. Does anyone really want the JOKER of all people to be sympathetic?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,what a shame..Nolan should have directed this not Phillips!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"First he ruined cash, now he ruins the joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like the origin story of Ronald McDonald
-_DJEzZk2pc,I talk shit on every single Joker.... This is the first time i think they nailed it
-_DJEzZk2pc,That looks fucking terrible.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this real? Because if so why
-_DJEzZk2pc,Johnny Cash specifically wanted JP to play him in the movie Walk The Line. If Johnny Cash had that much faith in him then I think he deserves the opportunity to put his mark on the Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks fkn awesome
-_DJEzZk2pc,It looks great. Its like a mix of heath and jack
-_DJEzZk2pc,The jew fears the clown.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The soundtrack is beautiful and fits so perfectly with the mood of the movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Another dark joker?





(Starts planning funeral)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Finally, a superhero/villain movie I might actually watch."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath ledger was the best joker but sadly he died
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why does this trailer sound so inspiring?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If he pisssed me off in every movie I saw him as a negative character yes he is fucking good, and yes this will be amazing."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I just looked him up on Google, he looks way different"
-_DJEzZk2pc,The joker was once s good guy until Batman pushed him into toxic waste
-_DJEzZk2pc,"eh , im lowkey feeling it"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Huh....not bad
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I used to think that my life was a tragedy, but now I realized it's a comedy üÉè"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ok, Joker origin story, yeah, I suppose. Created by- clown bullying, hmmm, not sure I buy that. I guess we're supposed to feel sympathy for the Joker this time around. Can you do that without painting Batman as an extreme nutjob asshole in the process? Probably not."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is it just me or is it crazy to watch this trailer so many times... glup!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can‚Äôt believe a bunch of YouTube morons where saying macaulay culkin should play the new joker role... bunch of dumb teenagers
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger was the best actor playing Joker hands down. This movie does not even come close to the acting Heath did in the Batman movies
-_DJEzZk2pc,...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm not gonna lie, I thought this would be horrible, but seeing this trailer it looks pretty good."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can't wait
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hmm....nope. Just doesn't feel like the Joker I'm familiar too much via comics/cartoons/movies/games at all.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm intrigued, nice."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Two atlanta actors in one trailer üôÉ I‚Äôm cheesing so hard
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Didn't know it was Phoenix playing the part. I try to avoid as much info as I can. Having said this, I'm not watching this video either lol."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie looks like garage
-_DJEzZk2pc,I knew he is a great actor but I just couldn't see him as the joker. This has blown my fuckin mind
-_DJEzZk2pc,wow. just. wow
-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôm okay with this üëå
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It 's gonna be another failed Joker : so many other vilains in DC world : why the f*ck do they keep trying to ressucitate Heath Ledger ? NO ACTOR can be as good as Ledger when it comes to the Joker.


Oh wait, i know why... 
...
Greed."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks good. It better be good. So sick of these modern films that are nothing but cgi garbage and graphic showoffs
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nice....
-_DJEzZk2pc,Lol I‚Äôm def saving big money cuz I‚Äôm not seeing this shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,Kinda reminds me of the clown from Terrifier
-_DJEzZk2pc,maybe he is the second best joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This shit is gonna be fuckin great, JP is a great choice...please be rated a hard R"
-_DJEzZk2pc,looks so much better than those shit Christopher Nolan movies :/
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks like shit. Leto did a better job
-_DJEzZk2pc,owaw
-_DJEzZk2pc,"1:59 is that Rupert Pupkin, The King of Comedy ?????"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The new joker is puertorican..
Thats whats up üëå"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Damn we really live in a society üòî
-_DJEzZk2pc,heath was the last joker. whats this crap?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I already knew when they announced Joaquin Phoenix that he would do an incredible job as the joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I cant wait to see stan lee's cameo
-_DJEzZk2pc,about time we get a villain movie tired of hero movies
-_DJEzZk2pc,Could be the dumbest movie ever made.
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC not playing
-_DJEzZk2pc,I got a good feeling about this one.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gary Gulman sighting!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker would work great Edward Norton they would get along great
-_DJEzZk2pc,That doesn‚Äôt go in any way with the DC movies and comics robin was made into joker he wasn‚Äôt just some depressed middle aged man what about suicide squad that goes no where in the story line
-_DJEzZk2pc,While I do agree it looks like a great film I don't think the look they're going for should be playing off of Heath's joker. Unless Nolan is the director again
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Gonna love this movie, i hated the new Joker i saw in the suicide squad. I mean the tattood Joker looked nothing like the Joker looked more as a pimp than the Joker.

This is more the sick minded man you expect the joker would be"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Shit better then that pimp joker in suicide squad
-_DJEzZk2pc,"different actors bring out different phases of the joker, Jack Nicholson brought out the crazy joker, Caesar Romero brought out the silly joking side,  Heath Ledger brought out the the iconic chaos joker, Jared Leto brought out the Over possessive romantic gangster side of joker and this joker is going to portray a more origin backstory side of the joker. every actor has his own view of the character."
-_DJEzZk2pc,So Ted Bundy was the Joker?
-_DJEzZk2pc,yes please!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"ok. lonely guy goes crazy, got it. but how does one become a super villain with all the criminal skills that go with it?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I love it!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oscar
-_DJEzZk2pc,This one looks like the worst joker yet. Heath ledger will never be topped...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'll be honest, at first I wasn't so sure about the overall design, it didn't seem... flamboyant enough? 
I don't know, but after seeing how he moves in it, Phoenix just won me over."
-_DJEzZk2pc,A real joker don't need hands
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope he quits this *acting nonsense* and gets back to rapping.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Let's hope this movie adds up to its potentialüôèü§û
-_DJEzZk2pc,Perfect
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think Joaquin will pull it off but I still think that Duane Johnson would be better.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I think this one will be good for DC. A nice change from the overly CGI movies. Oh, and hell yes for Joaquin."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joker is one of my favotites characters, but i belive that this trailer could be different. Showing more ironic or the 'psicolgy power' that joker have"
-_DJEzZk2pc,What happened to Jared Leto?
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks like shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gotham has a curse thats how Arthur Fleck became the Pale Man
-_DJEzZk2pc,"All this is gonna do is shit all over Batman lore but still make us feel really, really shitty that there are actual people out there who let the worst of society consume them and destroy their view of the world"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Aw man I wanna see it!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Amazing!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Bro, F*******ing YESSSS"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I would take this Joker movie over another Batman movie anyday
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,Better then that Suicide Squad bullshit.
-_DJEzZk2pc,That ending makeup reminded me of the mask heath ledger used in the dark night  bank robbery in the beginning
-_DJEzZk2pc,The real joker üÉè is dead all those are nothing
-_DJEzZk2pc,There is no other Joker after Heath Ledger!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Booooo
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Oh hell yes, a Joker origin story is brilliant!  Joaquin is one of my favorite actors, such an unexpected choice but will turn out amazing.  Thank you to everyone putting this together!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,i love JOKER very Much HAHAHAHAH :D
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Pause @ 0:28 





This shit is gonna get deep"
-_DJEzZk2pc,x
-_DJEzZk2pc,meh
-_DJEzZk2pc,"gamers, you know what to do."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gay!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Here comes the clown scare across the nation again
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can't wait.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks alright, if this movie ties to the Batman that they're working on that would be a best bait n switch"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"uhmmmm..... naah,  that¬¥s not Mr. J"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Anyone else feel like they know 90% of the movie already?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""Eh.."""
-_DJEzZk2pc,My body is ready
-_DJEzZk2pc,This shit trash
-_DJEzZk2pc,No... nobody else but Heath ledger can play the Joker...
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:26 if this laugh does not convince you that he is the perfect joker i don't know what will.
-_DJEzZk2pc,holy fuck
-_DJEzZk2pc,My city is like Gotham. Except we ain‚Äôt got no Batman. The Bay is murder capitol of Ontario. Gangs. Drug dealers. Hooligans. Teens trying to be tough. Corrupt police force. Someday. Someone is gunna snap.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Okay... I see what you're doing DC... and I LIKE it üòÉ
-_DJEzZk2pc,Huh....this makes me feel weird
-_DJEzZk2pc,Never thought I'd see joker dancing in his underwear but ok let's watch.
-_DJEzZk2pc,whos asking for these shit movies?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Let's put a smile on that face.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This could be promising.
However, for *a different* Joker, we should see Willem DeFoe  üòà"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sickk
-_DJEzZk2pc,"no thanks, looks shite"
-_DJEzZk2pc,My hype just went to 11 fam
-_DJEzZk2pc,"0:56 .... now that is the joker, just perfectly portrayed IMO"
-_DJEzZk2pc,And we wonder why they world has major issues.. Thanks Hollywood..
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow, his body!üò≥üò±"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks s**t!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I really hope they don't skewer his backstory that much
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks gay af
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally something good from D.C....cant wait to see it...joker is such a character and he has the skills to play that role...
-_DJEzZk2pc,hope no one dies in this movie 'i mean as the actors  such a sad movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks dumb...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Sadly, no one will ever capture The Joker like Heath Ledger did. RIP."
-_DJEzZk2pc,yeah this looks like a comic book movie i would actually watch
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joker in 1989: made from chemicals
Joker in 2019: made from society"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Probably going to end dumb and boring like Man of Steel and Batman v. Superman. Don't even get me started on Suicide Squad.
-_DJEzZk2pc,What if... now hear me out here.. this is the original joker. And Jared Leto Joker was another person who wanted to be the Joker so badly that he ended up being a giant try hard and that‚Äôs why the Joker in Suicide Squad was so over doneüò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm really into this Joker,They finally give us more background to it and if i'm not mistaken,even give us proof that bruce met Joker before this,and had a mutual relationship before hand,all in all this is gonna be a pretty fun adventure for the dc fans who arent judging it for it's trailer, something DC sucks at"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hard pass.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks to be the best DC movie since The Dark Knight
-_DJEzZk2pc,i watch this nearly every day. hands down obsessed
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Phoenix Amazing!!!! De Niro, get rid of the traitor it hurts to look at his mug, useless fake italian."
-_DJEzZk2pc,‚ÄúWhy so serious?‚Äù
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is Batman in this movie?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Thanks for sharing. nice
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yessss!!!! This looks awesome. Looking forward to this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please tell me De Niro is Rupert Pupkin
-_DJEzZk2pc,We need the Joker nowdays.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Thank goodness it's not a ""fanny boy"" joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,No wonder he's crazy. He's an american
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks like the joker just gets the shit kicked out of him the whole film but hey life's too short to care so carve a smile into ur face with a blade and you'll be smiling forever ,üí•"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Movies not even out yet and you can tell that joaquin is gonna be 1 of the best jokers
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Oh please.  Don't give us another tragic villain who is a product of his environment (had a rough childhood).  The original Joker was a psychopath, famous for growing up in normal families and hiding their true personalities.  Just plain evil. Throw away the hankie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I know a few joker fans that can't wait for the movie to come out.
Honestly for me this movie looks like sht. Most of the movie will be boring and the only action will be him getting the sht kicked out of him without him fighting back... Then the last minutes of they movie he will kill some people and become a psyco...

I'll hard pass... I'm bored just thinking about this movie..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I have high hopes for this movie. The trailer suggests that it could be good... An in depth look into the joker's mind and character, other than the one we're already accustomed to is an interesting angle to explore. I just hope that they won't ruin the movie with CGI and useless explosions and action scenes...."
-_DJEzZk2pc,How Many jokers Is too Many jokers?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"You know what, this actually looks pretty good."
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC doesn't need an ace up its sleeve- it has a joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Aren't there any action scenes?!?!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Meh..
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is going to squash the last queer joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why so SERIOUS!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin is a Marvellous actor.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Stfu about heath ledger!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The stairs represent sanity/ conforming to the expectation to appear sane. He is barely able to climb them in one shot. Cut to his jokes: ""the worst part about having a mental illness is people to expect you to behave like you don't."" He knows in his heart that he can't climb to the peak of those stairs alive. Later, in full Joker costume and makeup, he accepts himself for his differences, and doesn't just choose to go down those steps- he DANCES down them"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Stop right there Batman. We can handle this
-_DJEzZk2pc,I just wish it was heath
-_DJEzZk2pc,we really do love in a society though
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm a rapper now!!  What?!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie show us that bad people aren't bad they just been threw hell and no mercy so they turned like that
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can't wait for this! Joaquin is an amazing actor
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks pretty shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,I am so happy with the positivity shown for this movie so far <3
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It hurts my heart to watch this trailer 
Sorry but am not watching this movie I feel so sorry for the poor clown and the abuse he gets from Gotham he laughs they beat him up  
 
üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ poor soul fuck you Gotham burn in hell"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is it just me or does Joaquin's Joker suit kinda looks like the one Cesar Romeros Joker would wear?
-_DJEzZk2pc,now yuo see...
-_DJEzZk2pc,yes
-_DJEzZk2pc,...yes.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is gonna be so fucking epic.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I never wanted to see a movie more
-_DJEzZk2pc,Kinda sad what happened in the beginning. He was just tryna do some good...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Brandon Lee?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is the tune in the end from a popular pop song? What is it?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks lame as fuck. Nothing special from a nothing special Actor...
-_DJEzZk2pc,I love the version of Smile that‚Äôs in this trailer.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I see this taking the scene from The Dark Knight Returns when Mr. J greases the entire late night audience and host
-_DJEzZk2pc,"he seemed so nice until those kids hurt him,,, kids can be so cruel. :'("
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker in Atlanta...
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can't stop watching this.  This is going to be great.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"There hasn't been anything funny about the Joker since the Dark Knight/Nolan series began, that's the irony.

They've decided to make the Joker so fucking dark and twisted, to keep the new age millenials entertained, that he resembles little of the original character and is actually not one bit funny. Just creepy and demented. Not funny at all. Call him the Psychopath instead."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Smile! Charlie Chaplin! Perfect parts of the trailer. Such good choices.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"You know about that running gag about when a movie trailer is better than the actual movie itself?

I hope its not the case on this one."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This trailer is so good. Finally a trailer that doesn't spoil everything and truly intrigues people. I have a feeling we are really gonna empathize for the Joker, which is always something complex and wonderful. I can't wait to see this!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,this looks horrible
-_DJEzZk2pc,Mal√≠simo... Se desfigur√≥ tanto la m√≠tica figura del personaje de Jack Nicholson que ya est√° siendo idiota...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh fuck this looks good
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel so bad
-_DJEzZk2pc,All I have to say is Heath Ledger was born to play The Joker. Even the guy that plays the Joker in Suicide Squad is pretty good so why not just roll with that cuz he played The Joker pretty well but Heath Ledger you will always be the best. He brought the Joker to life like you would literally think that guy would be like in real life. I.m.o
-_DJEzZk2pc,"is it me, or everybody that plays joker ends up mental disturbed??"
-_DJEzZk2pc,this looks pretty lame
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is finna be ICONIC.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This doesn't  look all that at all
-_DJEzZk2pc,October can‚Äôt get here fast enough.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Worst joker yet ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where are Batman and Harley in this trailer? üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow... unexpecting but PERFECT!
-_DJEzZk2pc,why doesthislook like complete BS. Shazam wasn't even all of that come on DC
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I‚Äôm pretty sure if joker completed his mission he would stop being the joker, just like in that one comic where he thought he killed batman so he just bought an apartment and had a normal life"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Everyone: DC is too dark
DC: Lets make it darker
Everyone: This movie is going to be awesome!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Meh, not impressed with the trailer."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Comments full of people dick riding a dead dude. Ledger is long gone, he wasn't /that great/as the Joker, the fucking dark knight movie wasn't even that great. Move on."
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:09 when that friend tell a terrible joke but you still got their back
-_DJEzZk2pc,I expect to see the cover for this film to be plastered in those gold award stamps that usually adorn arthouse films.
-_DJEzZk2pc,First shot of him in the trailer...lookin' like Jack Nicholson in The Shining.  I like this already.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Shit looks lame af
-_DJEzZk2pc,Blah
-_DJEzZk2pc,Would it would have been better if he used Heaths voice for the character?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm really wondering if he is the same Joker from Dark Knight, with the same hidden backstory. It's suggested that he was ex military, this seems to be a purely mental version of Joker with no physical ability lol"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Aight DC I see you going towards the darker themed Nolan style movies. Last thing anyone wants is another superhero movie with cheesy one liners and one dimensional characters (captain marvel, Shazam, etc.). But this looks promising."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks dumb. Nothing in the trailer that gave me a reaction.......boring.
-_DJEzZk2pc,How shit does this look
-_DJEzZk2pc,God i pray this isnt as dog shit as suicide squad
-_DJEzZk2pc,Got Marvel shaking in their boots! This shit has way more potential..
-_DJEzZk2pc,Loving the vintage looking purple tux. It kinda fits the joker better when it has a cleaner look to it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I miss Heath Ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,Lokey tripy
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""Catwoman"" 2019."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hmm. Not feeling it. I'll reserve  judgment till  I watch it but so far not impressed.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I have never in my life been so addicted to a trailer of a movie...A TRAILER!! I can‚Äôt wait for it to come out 5 more months
-_DJEzZk2pc,Clown makeup needs to be more worn out and faded
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dumb
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Why can‚Äôt they release this in summer, I don‚Äôt want to wait till October."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"this trailer is disturbing, and sometimes I find JP disturbing (don't know why, just do).  I can see I'm gonna have to see this alone cause wife will want nothing to do with it.  Looking forward to this one."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Cities are hellholes created by leftist policies.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think I'm going to hate this guy as much as Commodus in Gladiator.  This of course is a good thing.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This has to be the absolute WORST Joker I have ever seen. I was so disappointed with this trailer that I definitely won't be buying any tickets to see this. DC is losing the war with Marvel for reasons just like this. Now understand, this is only MY opinion. I just think DC needs to step up their game.  How many different movies are they going to keep making with completely different Jokers in every one? Like Batman for example, so many sequels and constantly changing who plays Batman while keeping other roles with the SAME actors. IDK, I'm just not impressed at all, and I was pumped when they announced they were making a Joker movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks like the worst comic book movie ever.
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:09 when the special ed kid gets caught running away.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think the real joker is back
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now that's the first time I've felt even a bit scared and uncomfortable watching a live portrayal of the joker. And I've been watching live action portrayals of the joker for over 40 years. This has the chance to be incredible.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I.... Just thank you. I hope.
-_DJEzZk2pc,It will not be seen by me. üëé
-_DJEzZk2pc,I wish they had his dad cut his cheeks
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I don‚Äôt think any Joker is better than any other. Every Joker that presented delivers a different feeling to the character, an outstanding development imho. I.e., Heath Ledger showed a more sinister joker (my personal fav.)  and this one seems to present a more emotionally dramatic vibe. Looking forward to this film! There‚Äôs a beauty in every Joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"(Very end of film)

*The Joker sits across a table to a blonde Psychiatrist, his wrists bound to the table. staring in eachothers eyes, a long silence between them*
Psychiatrist - Is that right?
Joker - *let's off a large grin* ""I suppose it could be""

End.

Even the joker doesn't know his origin story, just makes it up everytime."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Has my vote for an Emmy!wow!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Total trash
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""it only takes one bad day..."""
-_DJEzZk2pc,Despite being 13% of the population...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I don't know... The ""victim of society"" issue is very exploited already. What I liked about the Nolan's Joker was that he was a mystery, just chaos, without a reason. Just the chaos. 
But I hope this movie will be great. Phoenix is a beast."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fuck this movie gon be good
-_DJEzZk2pc,Best joker Ive seen.
-_DJEzZk2pc,They should have retired the joker after .the last guy . In is honor.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel bad for joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,River Phoenix would be proud.
-_DJEzZk2pc,oh fuck dude
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like another failed D.C. comic book movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Phoenix looks like he is going to do the role proud!!!! Can't wait!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Rip Kid.
-_DJEzZk2pc,What happened to Jared Leto?
-_DJEzZk2pc,No joker will ever come close to Heath Ledgers portrayal of the joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don‚Äôt like it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Official origin story for Heaths Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I don't like it ..I want my villains to be what they're evil, I don't want to know that they have a sad side or human side fuck that."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Never been this scared watching the Joker character before - remembering JP's rap days..scary JP
-_DJEzZk2pc,Love it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh yeah!
-_DJEzZk2pc,It is going to be a flop.... remember what I said. 9:09 am Monday April 8 2019
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Man, this is gonna be some boring shit. Oh people were inhumanly and unlikely evil to him so he became who he is? That is some boring shit right there"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hello world huge Joker fan can't wait for the movie but can anybody help me find the location of the stairs I live in New York and I'm pretty sure it's somewhere in New York I thought it was the Bronx I went hunting for the stairs today and could not find them and anybody help me out
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like a loser
-_DJEzZk2pc,They have to stop producing the film of joker by respect to Heath Ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,Holy shit.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Damn, this looks creepy as hell. Can‚Äôt wait üôÇ"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Boring
-_DJEzZk2pc,*WHY AREN'T YOU LAUGHING!?*
-_DJEzZk2pc,Valuable message here kids.... don‚Äôt sleep with your computer. Inevitably she will break your heart sending you spiraling downward into clown hell. It‚Äôs not a pretty site.
-_DJEzZk2pc,ŸäÿßÿØŸä ÿßŸÑÿßŸÉÿ™ÿ¶ÿßÿ® ü§¶
-_DJEzZk2pc,JOAQUIN PHOENIX I LOVE YOU
-_DJEzZk2pc,But I‚Äôm still going to go watch it
-_DJEzZk2pc,e a√≠ gay
-_DJEzZk2pc,It Doesn‚Äôt look that good
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks like shit. This guy doesnt come off as a crazy and murderous psychopath at all. He looks like a school shooter who was bullied in high school.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Finally a movie with some origin of the joker, even though if anyone read a comic theyd know the joker is the way he is because he knows he is in a comic and his actions have no real consequences"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don't get it. A comic book movie without an SJW message? Weird.
-_DJEzZk2pc,There is no happiness without sadness. Don't be so quick to dismiss the good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,70s New York City looked scary.
-_DJEzZk2pc,this movie looks weak. stop thinking this is some creative genius shit. shits trash
-_DJEzZk2pc,joker will do something harmful to bruce and thomas will be a possible batman.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I feel bad for Leto.  His Joker is not unprecedented in comics.   They wanted to take inspiration from the comic book gangster Joker.  I think it was ruined due to two main factors: a shitty movie around him, and the upper type people wanting someone to match their version of Harley Quinn.  Both of these are unfortunate for different reasons.  I wonder if Leto was given a better director with more vision and more freedom if he wouldn't be able to do it justice.  I think there is a chance he might."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Just stopped by to say this movie wouldn't exist if it weren't for Heath Ledger.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The song is smile by Charlie Chaplin. A Jermaine sang this at Michael Jackson's memorial. Fitting.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"He wont do sequels, if this movie is amazing then it will be the saddest thing ever to loose another Joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can't wait!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This looks really good, although many movies with Joaquin Phoenix looked good and turned out to be ... meh. If you think about it, of all the DC movies, those with the Joker were the best. Jack Nickholson, Heath Ledger, and even Jared Leto. Maybe actual The Joker movie will be a real success. Let's hope."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin is going to tear it up as the Joker with out a doubt
-_DJEzZk2pc,Good to see some Atlanta stars in this
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can't believe I have to wait until October for this masterpiece. The trailer itself already gave it justice
-_DJEzZk2pc,what's his name must be rolling in his grave.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Awesome
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow, I can't believe we live in a society"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is going to be a masterpiece!
-_DJEzZk2pc,this shit looks stupid as fuck
-_DJEzZk2pc,that's some deep shit...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"God damn, I hope this doesn't suck. Please be a good movie. Please be a good movie. Please be a good movie. Please be a good movie. Please be a good movie. Please be a good movie. Please be a good movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I am rooting for you Joker!! Show them how funny life can be.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm a bit confused...  Isn't ""The Killing Joke"" already an origin story?, So this movie will overwrite the cannon? is there a cannon?
While I like Batman movies I'm not deep into the fandom, so I'm not sure if this is some sort of spin-off or if the animated movie is a parallel universe or what.
Regardless, this movie looks awesome."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"R.I.P Heath Ledger. No disrespect to the man casted as the Joke, but this here was a movie that Heath wouldve DID AMAZING in!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,yall need to fuck off and just pick a joker. no need to a new joker every damn movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker? No way this is going to work. Great actor but won't be as the Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Rest in peace replauy button....
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally a good one
-_DJEzZk2pc,Batman is crying üò≠
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is that a joke?
-_DJEzZk2pc,This gon be the comeback for DC's Batman V. Superman Martha scene and the Justice League
-_DJEzZk2pc,It looks like he's basing it on Heath Ledger's Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"That joker is a pussy, what happened to the vat of acid like the old days. I sure as hell won't be watching that crap."
-_DJEzZk2pc,SJW's and degenerate society created the new joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"For those who didn't know, that is Bruce Wayne at 1:51"
-_DJEzZk2pc,So again their changing the joker actor pathetic.
-_DJEzZk2pc,First well made trailer I have seen this year
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath ledger did it better.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath ledger owns this role and possibly always will. Jared was shit and this just looks like some killer clown BS!
-_DJEzZk2pc,i will call it  right now.. this movie will run 2 hours and 53 mins
-_DJEzZk2pc,wooowww boy...now this is something...fucking dark!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"To me this movie looks terrible and boring, could someone explain why this would be a good movie to watch?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Screw the DCU, Aquaman, the CGI, Suicide Squad... this is the real deal!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"please dont be shit, please dont be shit, please dont be shit (or try to be kinda ledger or way too far away from ledger )"
-_DJEzZk2pc,That looks like its gonna be the best performance of all time
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow a trailer got me rotting for the Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm gonna like this. A story how a good man turns to a monster just so because of the world he lives in. He was created, not born."
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:17 My  ass coming home from work thinking that I have annoying Kids with a annoying yapping wife that only makes my day even worse.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Although I like superhero comics and cartoons, I am not a fan of superhero (or villain in this case) movies (usually overhyped and full of CGI) but I would watch this simply because Joaquin Phoenix is an amazing actor. I want to watch it because I know he'll portray the Joker in a fantastic way. He wasn't someone I would have expected in that role but now that he's in it, it just seems like 'why didn't anyone think of this before?!'"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Stand up comedian tells a lame ass joke


Audience: 1:08"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I would have more faith in the movie, but it‚Äôs made by D.C."
-_DJEzZk2pc,So why are we stealing half the cast of Atlanta?
-_DJEzZk2pc,This shit looks like it‚Äôs going to suck ass I‚Äôm tired of DC changing the story line of how these ppl became who they are DC is so inconsistent
-_DJEzZk2pc,No one will ever outplay Heath Ledger in this role. No one.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie is gonna fuckin suck
-_DJEzZk2pc,i can't wait to watch this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,It looks like the joker in this film might be like an anti hero? Like a twisted version of batman.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The making of a funny lunatic! How far will he get pushed before he snaps. This crazy trilogy will be amazing!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix Best Actor 2020 Oscars
-_DJEzZk2pc,Loved this!  Soo amazing! I did a reaction for this trailer! Go and check it out on my channel!! ü§°üòàüëèüèª
-_DJEzZk2pc,"1:16 , he will rule as joker , if Warner Studios want to recreate its DC Universe , they should built everything around Joaquins Joker, and they should find their batman pick as good as joaquin , and leave them."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally a worthy actor.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like shit not gonna lie
-_DJEzZk2pc,After years of disappointing movies I finally am excited about a movie coming out again.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Not only does the movie star one of the very best villain actors of all time, and delivers a killer story, but this actually has the potensial to be an important portrait of a failed society that the world we live in can learn from, both in terms of violence, bullying and mental illnesses. If the trailer is anything to go by, I'd say both the movie and Joaquin will recieve Oscars this year, and I can't wait for it to come out!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,So glad they didn't use that J Leto guyüòí
-_DJEzZk2pc,AM I NOT MERCIFUL?!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,The King of Comedy
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks amazing DC should just stick with stuff like this! they cant do cgi/fx very well
-_DJEzZk2pc,It looks so dumb
-_DJEzZk2pc,üò¥
-_DJEzZk2pc,Let‚Äôs hope the Illuminati doesn‚Äôt kill Joaquin now
-_DJEzZk2pc,"There better be black people and lgbt friendly 

I don't know about anyone else but I noticed there was not any and if this is a pro white film I'm going to publicly on Twitter  Shame everyone involved for not being inclusive"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This trailer made me half hard https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZHqRfkecWo&feature=share
-_DJEzZk2pc,Meh...
-_DJEzZk2pc,When this movie will release?
-_DJEzZk2pc,What's the name of that song please?
-_DJEzZk2pc,No more Ledger means no more Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie looks dumb it‚Äôs not worth watching
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks really interesting.  Partly because I did t see anything about ‚ÄúDC‚Äù anywhere.   I‚Äôm curious how/if that happened.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This has me so excited, just can‚Äôt stop watching it."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Just when I thought that prestigious cinematography was a thing of the past. Thanx Moore.
-_DJEzZk2pc,look another movie about the dumbest bad guy in comics
-_DJEzZk2pc,Roger Federer is a really good actor
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So....is ""The Joker"" good now. I'm so confused"
-_DJEzZk2pc,That looks so lame! Movie industry today sucks!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gamers rise up
-_DJEzZk2pc,The trailer is already better than the last Joker movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Well it looks like they ruined the jokers character
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where is my boy happy face scar?  Cant wait for this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wont be able to watch and enjoy after Ledger's performance.  He was way too damn good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fucking beautiful
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The first battle shots from SJW's have been fired against this movie in an all too predictable ""white males are evil"" trajectory. Critics will denounce this movie. They will smear it with their rabid psychotic leftist rants about 'white privilege, toxic masculinity and how despite the statistics which say otherwise white men are _actually_ the biggest threat to Amefican safety in coordinated hit pieces disguised as reviews and do all they can in order to see to it this movie fails. Ultimately, because the average movie goer wants nothing to do with their toxic politics, they will ignore their efforts. They will see this movie and it will be acclaimed by fans as one of the best Joker/DCU/Gotham movies ever made. 
Well, that's my prediction anyhow."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow! Looks amazing!! I can‚Äôt wait to be horribly disappointed!
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:09 sound of the JOKER
-_DJEzZk2pc,wtf is this? DC :(
-_DJEzZk2pc,üëè
-_DJEzZk2pc,Very good trailer. It looks better than the standard comic book film too. It looks properly deep. That's just judging by this trailer though.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Stupid

-_DJEzZk2pc,Fuck this trailer is amazing
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks amazing :) I really hope they don‚Äôt ruin it. Joaquin Phoenix looks like a good joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,this trailer already looks better than all the dc movies that came out so far
-_DJEzZk2pc,No one will ever replace the REAL joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"wow, didnt think anyone could ever play joker better than heath ledger.  but, damn, joaquin looks like he could be nominated for an oscar here."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"They do realize he is a complete and utter sociopath/psychopath right?  I mean this movie makes it seem like he just wanted to make people smile but went bad... but wasn‚Äôt it more? I haven‚Äôt read the comics and I don‚Äôt know his back story, but this doesn‚Äôt feel like the right origin story, anyone else agree? Or is it just me who feels that way..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,That thing not a joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Thumbs up if you think Marvel is Better than DC
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Didn‚Äôt his father cut his face and put a permanent smile on it?
That‚Äôs what Joker said in Black Knight. 

But sure, trailer is promising and I love Joaquin."

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks shit , nothing compared to Heath Ledger and Jared Leto"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looking forward to this üé• He becomes who he was meant to be!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Way better than jared letto from sucide squad i couldnt stand his joker character or that stupid movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Based and honkpilled
-_DJEzZk2pc,WB didn't give Phoenix Joker the gangster origin because it's still belongs to Jared joker. WB is the reason DC will never be good.. Disney would have been dump Jared joker and replace him Phoenix Joker.. But WB thinks a punk rock Joker with platinum teeth and tattoos is they way to goodüòÜüòÜüòÜ
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Horrible!!! Would have been better if his hardships led him to become a hard core gangster then the joker... but not like this...the story line is fucked up...he becomes the clown after the toxic drop not before!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nope
-_DJEzZk2pc,Move over Marvel
-_DJEzZk2pc,AMAZING
-_DJEzZk2pc,"ok...after i saw the new design for the Joker i thought the movie was gonna suck...but now, if i ignore the design, it looks pretty rad"

-_DJEzZk2pc,Crazy is back!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This actually has me interested. He looks like hes really going for it as the Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,You wanna know...how I got these scars?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"What‚Äôs this feeling I‚Äôm experiencing, it‚Äôs so weird...!

Crap I think it‚Äôs actual excitement for a movie, damn it‚Äôs been awhile!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Zero interest.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin Phoenix looks great, otherwise this looks like another DC disaster.


For purist like me: why does he have a name? The Joker has been around for 90 years and we never learned his name. This is about as exciting as finding out how Han Solo got his name. I know some will point at the Killing Joke and some other ""origins"" (all of which are terrible and ruin the character). Sorry, but Alan Moore is Alan Moore. His work is amazing, but it's always non-canon because...Alan Moore. The man earned the right to take on these ideas, not these vampires that are still trying to squeeze blood out of the corpse of Heath Ledge over a decade later.


Why is Bruce Wayne a kid? The Joker is almost always roughly the same age as Batman, not what appears to be 30 years his senior. This tends to be the case because Batman created the Joker, except now he didn't? And apparently when The Batman arrives 15 years later the Joker will be an old man? What? Did ANYONE consider that their best villian will be in his 60s when doing battle with Batman now?


Why is Joker created by society? Every Batman fan alive knows that without Batman, the Joker doesn't exist. He exist because Batman exists. This was done masterfully in The Dark Knight Returns when after Batman retired the Joker didn't say a word for decades and then, while watching the news and seeing Batman has returned, a big smirk cracks across his face. But sure, society created The Joker...mind blown.


Anyway, enjoy ruining another cherished DC character. At least Joaquin will make this dumpster fire entertaining."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It looks so good. Joaquin Phoenix is good in everything he does, and I'm ready for it."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Huele a oscar :v
-_DJEzZk2pc,Idk but this ain‚Äôt the joker I‚Äôm used too seems like he grew up a punk and all of a sudden he‚Äôs the biggest baddest criminal in Gotham with a snub nose revolver lol okay üëåüèº
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think DC is trying to pull up it‚Äôs socks. Nice to see.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Well this looks stupid but whatever all comics have to be stupid in 2019
-_DJEzZk2pc,Love the long ledger hair
-_DJEzZk2pc,that is a pooooooooooor excuse of a joker...  hell to the fuck no
-_DJEzZk2pc,Thats how DC-Movies should be!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks uninteresting this movie :-(
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fucking October??
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin is the only actor who might be able to compare to Heath Ledger‚Äôs Joker. I‚Äôm pumped.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ronald mc Donald head ass
-_DJEzZk2pc,He will own this part no doubt. But already comparing this role to Heath Legder‚Äôs portrayal? Don‚Äôt know about that...
-_DJEzZk2pc,A movie about the joker? I'm smiling already.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hope you're paying attention Marvel..... This is how you make a movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This the best trailer I've seen in a while
-_DJEzZk2pc,Bad ass.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don't know how i feel about this......
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Mr. Phoenix is amazing, but I just can feel it in my bones that the movie is not going to work. :/"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This movie is...
Stuuuuuuuuupid!!!!!"

-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks horrible!
-_DJEzZk2pc,He doesn't have the scars like he should. Dislike

-_DJEzZk2pc,meh

-_DJEzZk2pc,"His Joker laugh is absolutely spot on üò± It made me shed a tear :,)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,it breaks my heart at 0:32 how hes helplessly running after them to get the sign i hate scenes like that in movies
-_DJEzZk2pc,Song?
-_DJEzZk2pc,finally an actual crazy person is gonna play the joker. fuck that stupid ass 40 year old hipster jared leto.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally the Joker is just a broken man instead of some eccentric gangster who wears makeup.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Unidentified
-_DJEzZk2pc,ü§¢ü§Æ
-_DJEzZk2pc,Batman is boring as fuck. (personal opinion) but man this looks good. The joker should be the heroe.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh this got to be better than stupid hero movies in these days
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie is called joker but I see no joker???
-_DJEzZk2pc,This joker was inspired by Tommy Wiseau.
-_DJEzZk2pc,That guy looks like Ronald McDonald... just geht used to the fact that there will be no second Heath Ledger and stop trying to present us guys like this
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks stupid.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I got an excellent idea. Take all the money used in this pointless movie and use it for like helping people in need......
-_DJEzZk2pc,This trailer was officially released on Heath Ledger's birthday in the Australian Timezone. A tribute that hopefully will not disappoint.
-_DJEzZk2pc,No one will ever live up to Heath Ledger's Joker!
-_DJEzZk2pc,You cant exchange the real Joker...rip Heath....
-_DJEzZk2pc,Here‚Äôs a crazy thought...What if all of Phoenix‚Äôs erratic and eccentric behavior over the years was all one big method acting exercise for this very role?? Out there I know but imagine if it were!üò±üò≥. Hyped for this adaptation of the Clown Prince of Crime!!üò±üò±

-_DJEzZk2pc,Omg!!! I love joker charachter. Here he comesss againüòçüòçüòç
-_DJEzZk2pc,Its gonna be artistic no action at all.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I have a feeling about this one. And it is implying it to be a future classic. JP‚Äôs joker may well end up there with HL‚Äôs. Definitely looks the part too. Finally.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Next actor that goes insane after playing the Joker says 1:05
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Terrible, hard pass."

-_DJEzZk2pc,How much meth did  Joaquin Phoenix have to smoke üí® For this role
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel you joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dc needs a villian based interconnected universe. Tell the story from the villians point of view and the darkness would be justified. Question would then become who would be dc villian nick fury to connect everyone.
-_DJEzZk2pc,River Phoenix's soul lives on through Joaquin
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks like a completely unrelated movie that was retooled as a DC property for marquee value. Looks good though
-_DJEzZk2pc,5k dislikes dafaq
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I hope we don't see Batman.  Maybe some nods to him and other DC characters, but I'd much rather see this movie with the Joker as a standalone character.  Either way, this trailer definitely bought my ticket!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is ganna be good
-_DJEzZk2pc,excellent ‚öî
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:30 The feel like that‚Äôs the most perfect run for the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not loving this origin. The joker is more than just some guy who has been roughed up a couple times.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Learned my lesson to NEver be fooled by a trailer.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now we get the REAL successor to Heath Ledger. Much better than Jared Leto's 5-minutes-of-screentime role in Suicide Squad. That was a huge wasted potential. But this? This is gonna be amazing.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this some kind of sick joke!?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks lousy
-_DJEzZk2pc,they had me at Joaquin Phoenix is the Joker...

-_DJEzZk2pc,I think joker can‚Äôt die and that‚Äôs how he became how he is rn
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie is going to suck ass.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"To be honest for the first part of this I was like ""oh hell no... Wtf is this turf of a story line?"" ... But by the end I was a believer. Looks really intetesting."
-_DJEzZk2pc,No I want the joker  from  suicide squad
-_DJEzZk2pc,terrible . trying to hard to act creapy. health ledger is THE JOKER together with jack. also whoever made this trailer should be fired
-_DJEzZk2pc,It wasny jokers fault the hull time it was the people this is just sad
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why are there so many batmans and jokers
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can't wait!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Reboot the original batman instead of making up new chapters
-_DJEzZk2pc,"They just ruined the joker... stop this film from being released, seriously. The face paint, the colors, everything is absolutely garbage. Why not just keep Jared Letto? He nailed it as the new joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Getting a serious Ledger vibe from him and in a good way.  This has some serious potential.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Meh looks ok
-_DJEzZk2pc,Okay but why does he look like Phil Dunphy
-_DJEzZk2pc,After Heath Ledger I was immediately disinterested in anyone touching the Joker again. Couldn‚Äôt be topped. Joaquin Phoenix actually looks like he‚Äôll almost be on par. I genuinely can‚Äôt wait for this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I really hope this movie is good
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:04 Is this Big E from New Day (WWE Wrestler) ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,That was a pretty boring trailer.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If you ignore all the other films Todd Phillips has done, this means we're getting a Joker story by the guy behind Hated: GG Allin & the Murder Junkies, which might be interesting."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why so serious?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Showing Joaquin Phoenix caring for his elderly mother invokes the idea that this is a stealth sequel to the brilliant but tragic You Were Never Really Here. (Recommended, but it involves child prostitution, PTSD, depression, and suicide.)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I would've preferred Willem Dafoe for the role of Joker simply because he just looks pure evil even without makeup. Let's give Joaquin Phoenix a chance.
-_DJEzZk2pc,it looks good just like it looked suicidal squad ... I hope they do not do the same and keep the dark and serious tone of the trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like a really promising psycho thriller. Looking forward to it!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I still think this movie is going to suck eggs and ass and that Phoenix guy but ugly it's going to be the biggest block of the year
-_DJEzZk2pc,Does anyone know the piece that starts playing in the background around 1:28? I've had it stuck in my head a few days now and can't find it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Here we go!!!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Well see. Not sold yet.. Trailer is very weak
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where is the Joker from suicide squad
-_DJEzZk2pc,This trailer is fuckin trash....Have a fucking brain and create something other than revamping other ideas you useless cunts
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is the world so devoid of new ideas that they have to keep rehashing comic book tripe over and over and OVER again. Just let it die for fuck sake.
-_DJEzZk2pc,How to ruin this movie is simple if the joker would have had a friend to front him some weed then the joker would never have exist
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks so fucking good lol. This can‚Äôt be Warner‚Äôs bros right?
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:09 The Joker quotes American Psycho.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I really don‚Äôt get it... the movie to me looks old and lame as shit... can someone please explain to me why everyone else is so exited about it... I hope I am wrong but I‚Äôm just not impressed
-_DJEzZk2pc,Actually pretty excited about this one. Makes you almost sympathetic for the joker. How a cruel society can drive a man just trying to get by insane.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Whats the name of this soundtrack??
-_DJEzZk2pc,They should just call it joker instead of dc
-_DJEzZk2pc,Have him be Heath Ledger's Joker's father and cut a smile into his son's face.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The music has a huge part in this one!  
it copies  ""Nessun Dorma"" 
That piece would make even a zombie crie :.) 

Just how Paul Potts won Britain's got talent with"
-_DJEzZk2pc,phoenix is going kill jar leto as the joker.   leto was very bad choice
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If the movie is just as good as the trailer, then we're good!!!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm no
-_DJEzZk2pc,At the start I feel bad for him
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks good, looks real good!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Well that looks fucking shite
-_DJEzZk2pc,After this movie mass shootings will increase..
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This looks terrible... usually I‚Äôm very into origin stories but Joker is extremely unique and I don‚Äôt think one should be done for him. Joker was more interesting in the Christopher Nolan movies because he just kept making stories up about why he had scars on his face. 

Even if I was for an origin story for Joker this one just looks... terrible..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This was so ...







Satisfying"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please for the love of god don‚Äôt fuck this up. DC needs a good few comebacks after the justice league movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks so different and I‚Äôm so excited to see the movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"good see Robert de noir in it, no  Leonardo DiCaprio"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The symbol of humanity‚Äôs own madness and evil, created by their own wrongdoings."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This looks good, but damn there are other villains in Gotham than the Joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks boring
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Here is the problem this movie faces, and they might even have to address it with reshoots. Simply going crazy, and losing your mind, is not actually enough when it comes to the Joker. The Joker is also a genius, he understands explosives, he is well trained in weapons, hand to hand combat, all I see in this film is a worm getting bullied. It would have made much more sense to have Arthur be a military vet who had an experience that disfigured him, lost his wife, etc. They better figure this out, or the movie will be pure garbage."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin can pull this off, i have 0 doubt this will be an amazing movie..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is anybody here who Knows the Name of the music at 1:28
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is Batman in this then.

-_DJEzZk2pc,"It's ok i like and love the joker. BUT when he's got immortal with balls that could manipulate time space and whatever i don't know what to do. Thats why i like the batman and joker ""romance"" just pure LOVE"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks horrible for a joker movie. DC is really fucking up there movies and timelines.
-_DJEzZk2pc,What's the song in the trailer? Someone help?
-_DJEzZk2pc,RIP Health Ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,"He should do taxi driver and play Robert D! 

Definitely"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow! He looks Great as the Joker!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This needs to be a Christopher Nolan film.
-_DJEzZk2pc,what is this fucking bull shit?
-_DJEzZk2pc,WTF motive did they have for stealing his sign and beating him with it???
-_DJEzZk2pc,Character should be put to rest after Heath Ledger's genius portrayal in The DK.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"He was actually a good man, but his life just gave upon him"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"He looks so powerful at the end, almost bulletproof.  Quite a contrast."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ooof. Jaquin Phoenix is a dark guy, this was a perfect choice.  The man is brilliant. I just hope he does okay after playing the character. Heath ledger and Jack Nicholson hit major depressions after playing the joker. It's a tremendously dark role."

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin, when you did the Thanksgiving dinner scene in Walk The Line. You were leaning back drinking a beer and told your Dad, ""Yeah, where were you?"". You looked like the Joker in that scene. I have been thinking that you should have been the Joker ever since."
-_DJEzZk2pc,That laugh at 1:27 üòç Perfection. I think Joaquin could carry on Ledgers performance. Maybe not as great but he can be just as good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin rocks! You just get that feeling this gonna be soooo good..
-_DJEzZk2pc,I would love to see him and the girl that plays Harley Quinn in suicide squad together in a movie. üòÉ
-_DJEzZk2pc,Are we finally going to get a decent Joker?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""Tomorrow you'll know I wasn't kidding and you'll all think I'm crazy. But I figure it this way: better to be king for a night, than a schmuck for a lifetime."""
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can't see this being as good as it should be
-_DJEzZk2pc,Poor joker living in a society :(
-_DJEzZk2pc,"For my favorite comic book villain, this trailer was sub par"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"1:51 ""Why so serious, son? Let's put a smile on that face""?
I never thought I'd love another Joker after Heath Ledger, but this one... god he's perfect"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks soo fuking stupid realy
-_DJEzZk2pc,But will we find out how he really got those scars?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sad that Ledger doesn‚Äôt play this one..
-_DJEzZk2pc,"1:38 At first I thought these posters were election posters from the penguin as the mayor of gotham, would have been a nice easter egg."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Aw man this ones gonna be really good. I can feel it
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It's so stupid that they show white men in suits punching the joker on the subway. Those are the financial criminals and the POC are the shooters, stabbers and punchers."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I found renewed hope when I saw him in the tighty whities. THIS should be his costume, running around in his soiled underwear and rubbing his penis against passers by including small children like Bruce Wayne and Lil Wayne. Then he should shit himself and eat his own shit to show how crazy/hungry he is/are. Reminds me of a time I was walking down some stairs to the kitchen but I had diarrhea and I slipped and fell hard, letting loose the liquid turds. There was shit everywhere and I was angry and disoriented. If the joker is similar to this he will be relatable."
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:08 that laugh tho
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Depressing Joker, I've never seen a depressing Joker before."
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:09
-_DJEzZk2pc,wtf is this
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's not a joke to be a joker..
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This has to be good. Please, be good."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"why can't there be an actual Joker in modern times that sticks with the actual comics?? He wasn't created by society, he fell into a batch of chemicals which screwed up his brain. He was pretty normal before that happened. Every rendition of the Joker pre 2000's has put this into light. The real debate is whether he was a gangster before the chemical accident but the idea that society created him is a bunch of bs and was never in the original comics. Tho I will say that the OG comics going back to the 30's never gave him a true back story. So it's tough and debatable. I like the chemical idea more than the whole society thing. We get enough of that nonsense in serial killer movies and documentaries, I want a more comic book aspect of it. Coming from a long time fan of DC"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I never knew the joker had cleft lip surgery scars.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Interesting cannot wait
-_DJEzZk2pc,I used to think my life was just a life. Now I'm a comic.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I have no interest in seeing this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,take my money
-_DJEzZk2pc,looks bad.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nice they're doing like a PSYCHO meets Joker thing
-_DJEzZk2pc,When i first saw this i legit thought it was a psa until they said Gotham :p
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's not out yet but please don't die Joaquin Phoenix we need you for the sequel
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I‚Äôm a simple man. I see not Jared Leto, I click like."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledgers Joker is OVERRATED. Stop bringing him up.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôve seen this trailer 20+ times!!! I love this so much
-_DJEzZk2pc,Very doubtful about this one..
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Well, definitely ""I'll look into it..."""
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Now their glorifying psychotic murderers.  ""They"" have no low."
-_DJEzZk2pc,He scares me
-_DJEzZk2pc,newark gang!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can't fucking wait. I hope Joaquin Phoenix finally gets the respect he so much deserves as an actor.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I fuck wid it
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin has been one of my favorite actors since Gladiator.
The man is a beast"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger‚Äôs Joker is still the masterpiece but this still looks very intriguing.  Love that it‚Äôs set in the early 1980‚Äôs.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin Phoenix will set his own mark as the joker. We need to stop comparing jokers, and appreciate each one as their own character. He will be amazing."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Heath ledger dope 
Jared leto tweak 
Joaqiun Phoenix lucy"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why is it that I imagine this to be more dark and saw esk. Like I imagine joker being more fucked up more evil.  I‚Äôm not hating on this already.  It just seems like a play to me...idk
-_DJEzZk2pc,‚ÄòFalling Down‚Äô DC edition?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I really can't fucking wait. This is the latest movie I've been hyped for in, like, a decade. I really hope that it'll be great! :)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,For those of you who didn‚Äòt know it yet: Joaquin Phoenix is younger than Jared Leto. Look it up!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Love the sound track though üÉè
üÉèIs back.
And Gotham needed him"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Like a lot of people I was skeptical,l but after seeing the trailer I think this could really work!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is one of the best trailers I've ever seen. I really hope the movie doesn't dissapoint.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I guess they runnin out of ideas ...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"That laugh tho, holy crap."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gamers only in these theaters üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§
-_DJEzZk2pc,The bronx‚Äôs famous stairs
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger made that character really interesting and DC has been trying to cash in on his ghost ever since. This looks better than the Leto abomination but still weak.
-_DJEzZk2pc,In the beginning I almost feel bad for the guy
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Loved Joaquin in Her, seems perfect for Joker as well"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is something fresh and new DC should try and do if they are going for a (NEW) MCU like movie planning, bring in the villain origin movies!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please be good
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Phoenix actually comes off as a clown in his mannerisms, as well as his mannerisms of someone with mental illness. Of course Ledger was great but I‚Äôm open to this interpretation. Looks interesting."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Cooooool!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Taxi driver?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"really good for a trailer, they didn't show the entire movie like some trailers do. kept us interested. I like that."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Please stop making Joker movies, nobody can top Heath"
-_DJEzZk2pc,A great actor!
-_DJEzZk2pc,thanks for ruining the best character of the dark knight. DC can get worse from here. I want to puke.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Garbage...
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:27 it‚Äôs looked just like Health Ledger @@
-_DJEzZk2pc,Awesome can‚Äôt wait to see thisüëç
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This trailer is perfect, it made me ever care about the movie. Hope they don't screw it up."

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Crispin Glover would have been perfect for this role. He's so delightfully creepy as Mr. World, and has the perfect face. I'm not feeling Joaquin Pheonix for this, at all. I also want to see Matthew Gray Gubler play Edward Nigma/the Riddler. Those two would be perfect for those roles."

-_DJEzZk2pc,YEEEEES SCREW THE SUICIDE SQUAD JOKER. I have high Hope's for this. Joker is one of the best villains of all time.
-_DJEzZk2pc,We need Heath Ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,He will die shortly after.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ooo what an original title. And storyline. The joker is deserving of way better backstory than this. This is 2 faces story already. And casting? At least try to find a newcomer who could kill it like Ledger did. They just will never find a good replacement I guess, and thats understandable. It would be near impossible. Im surprised they got away with teaching that kids raised by single moms turn out badly. But I agree."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks like a good movie.  Not the same old crap.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Booo
-_DJEzZk2pc,How many Jokers do we need?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I  somehow feel bad for the joker in this movie cause it seems like his life was terrible that made him go down the evil road
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks like pretencious crap
-_DJEzZk2pc,I guess he was not evil before they others were
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is gonna be the best joker ever period
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope batman kills this weirdo.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Marvel‚Äî Superheros
DC ‚Äî Supervillans"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If they fuck up this movie, im gonna be so fucking sad. Joker is the fucking shit, and to fuck that up, idk i think they would start to lose a lot of fucking money on their movies and such. Would probably have to make a new solo batman movie again XD"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"His notebook says ‚Äúthe worst part about having a mental illness is PEOPLE expect you to behave as if you DONT‚Äù.

-_DJEzZk2pc,Oooooh! A movie I might actually go see! Yessss!! Phoenix is the man!
-_DJEzZk2pc,We truly live in a society.

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow he got old, looks like shit lol"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger is the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,It‚Äôs he üëø
-_DJEzZk2pc,A little different but I like it!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I literally got the same ad before this ad. Is the universe telling me something?
-_DJEzZk2pc,THEY FUCKING RUINED IT. JOKER'S WHOLE CHARACTER IS THAT HE HAS NO BACKSTORY
-_DJEzZk2pc,God I hope DC doesn't fuck this up
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Heath Ledger must be so proud, looking from on high :)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,He‚Äôs a method actor.
-_DJEzZk2pc,What a power move. Joaquin is perfect for this role.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I like to think about Joker as a real superhero trying to put a smile on faces of his fellow citizens. Both before and after the transformation...
-_DJEzZk2pc,this gay af
-_DJEzZk2pc,This will be the best dc movie ever made.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"How the fuck you decide to do this after heath ledger dies, you know how much better this would be if you made this with heath ledger and not johnny fucking cash, but still looks good as fuck and im gonna watch lol :)"

-_DJEzZk2pc,boo
-_DJEzZk2pc,I've watched this trailer about a million times the more I watch it the more excited I am for it!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ugh... Just why him ??? Maybe I'm wrong but I just don't buy it. The makeup or any of it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:27 his final form joker laugh is absolutely brilliant
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""I always used to think my life was a tragedy, but now I realize it's a comedy"""

See, I'm not a monster. I'm just ahead of the curve."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Paperboy and Vanessa left Atlanta for this üò§
-_DJEzZk2pc,The joker and batman thing is played out. Boring
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm kind of confused. Is this another fan trailer? I thought the Joker movie died on the table and they never even finished filming? You keep hearing about one DC property after another tale spinning into the ground before filming even get started. I thought this went the same way.
-_DJEzZk2pc,It better be some killing in this movie because the trailer wasn't fulfilling
-_DJEzZk2pc,For Joaquin Phoenix this is going to be a career mic-dropp! Cant wait to see this masterpiece
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is the Red Hood in this?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I kinda just want to watch this to see how garbage its going to be
-_DJEzZk2pc,think this idiot can beat heath ledger? Nop
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think Joaquin Phoenix is the perfect person to do this.  He has the acting chops and i think this could be a great movie. Hope it gets an R rating
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please for once make a good DC movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like Phil but with long hair from Modern Family..
-_DJEzZk2pc,if there's no Harley I don't want it.

-_DJEzZk2pc,What how much weight did he loose for this role but my all time favorite actor please let this be good
-_DJEzZk2pc,Definitely got the right guy this time.
-_DJEzZk2pc,better than the dark knight
-_DJEzZk2pc,I really don't understand what is happening. What is this based on?
-_DJEzZk2pc,i already love this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Guys... Phoenix has been a good actor... have you guys seen the gladiator? I think everyone should praise the director
-_DJEzZk2pc,First of all a psychopath is just a term nobody is born psychopath society makes him psychopath....if no one will ever believe your feelings then you yourself crush your feelings and become a numb person which turns into psychopath....psychopaths are not born they are made...

-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker  needed  an actor and  the actor need a role to fit in and finally they got together ....!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"No batman?
Seriously?
You gonna make a joker movie without batman?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not feeling it...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I can already see this movie is gonna be a masterpiece, CAN'T WAIT FOR IT..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I fell like  this is the Joker we‚Äôve all been waiting for .
-_DJEzZk2pc,"looks like it could be a musical, its a meh from me"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why is there now 187 Joker origin stories and why does each one get a movie? FU Hollywood!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This should have been Leto.
-_DJEzZk2pc,It seems a reminiscence of the Last Circus by Alex de la Iglesia (2010) where at least two clowns became insane and disfigured by themselves.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Uuuhh...White banker chads in suits kick his ass on the subway...‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.ermmm, NOPE!"

-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm madly waiting for this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's scary how possible that premise really can be (outside of the clown makeup)
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This looks pretty good, please dont ruin it."
-_DJEzZk2pc,......
-_DJEzZk2pc,looks like heath ledger has some serious competition

Thanks in advance"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin is an amazing actor. He is going to kill this (in a good way). I think we are about to see an epic story, that is incredibly well acted."
-_DJEzZk2pc,The GREATEST Joker EVER was Cesar Romero!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is going to be great!
-_DJEzZk2pc,it is so intriguing what the trailer tells. I hope the movie will be different
-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôve never been more excited
-_DJEzZk2pc,HOLY SHIT!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Pleas for love of DC comics do not fuck this up!!!!!! It's the Joker not that kid shit Shazam.

-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker the story begins
-_DJEzZk2pc,snowflake joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"NGL, this looks dope af..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's not looking like something normal. It's looking purely dramatic movie. Something that's easily relatable. I'm impressed. It's going to be the biggest success of this year. I won't be fan of American Psycho of Christian Bale after watching this movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Maybe the kid who plays joker from Gotham will play joker when hes older
-_DJEzZk2pc,"How many more movies are gonna be made with the joker? Like I'm over it, there's tons of other cool characters in DC that haven't been in a movie yet"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yep hes definitely way better than leto
-_DJEzZk2pc,can they make this into a horror since its coming out in october
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow DC made a movie that I am excited to watch.

-_DJEzZk2pc,Horse shite
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I personally hope they don't portray him as mentally ill. I hope he is portrayed as evil incarnate. If I was to ever play the joker, that's how I'd portray him. As a man putting on an act, and a show. Someone who ""just wants to watch the world burn..."""

-_DJEzZk2pc,They should‚Äôve you‚Äôve suicide squad joker it would‚Äôve been betterüíØ
-_DJEzZk2pc,The story we never needed Joker is a character who's origin is supposed to be vauge and mysterious and usually tied directly into Batman in some form also the bigger the age gap you leave between Joker and Batman the more it makes Batman unimpressive as he is kicking the shit out of a old man.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks awesome!!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,trashüöÆ
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why a new Joker Story? Why a new Actor ? Same as with the others i give a f*** and skip such crap.

-_DJEzZk2pc,joker is iconic like batman and superman so this movie gotta be good or i will fucking kill someone
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""I laughed, but it hurt a little."""
-_DJEzZk2pc,Everyone saying Joaquin Phoenix is amazing blah blah blah but most probably didn't even know who he was till this I didn't know heth ledger till he was the joker

-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is going to Rock, So HARD...!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow I‚Äôm actually gonna see a real movie for once.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Jack Nicholson was the best before Heath Ledger came along. So. Many. haters. Now,  Heath Ledger was the best...This looks good and messed up. I'll see it and decide then!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,The joker is no villain. Just a very very happy man that got bullied...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Uuiuuuuuuu
-_DJEzZk2pc,So when does he kill robin? Lol
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks amazing. Can't wait for it!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Phoenix is going to be one of the best jokers ever. May even be on par with or perhaps even surpass Ledger's.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This, will be THE Joker. Bout damn time."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel like he killed those people on train ...which prolly made him go nuts ..
-_DJEzZk2pc,would love to see Willem Dafoe as joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Society rise UP
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Now this is the Joker, not that suicide squad failure.  He's even got his old suit on."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Please no origin story, I want mystery still yet... this trailer, filled with wonder! LOVED IT!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie looks really cool.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hate clowns...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Hope they manage to not fuck this one up. Studio executives, please stay away from this one."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel like this is a callback to the  1960's Joker when he was jut a guy in makeup and there was no chemicals
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wish I was joker. He fears no pain or death and doesn't care for the consequences of his choices. That is complete and total freedom.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks pretty terrible
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where's is Batman
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is not the Joker. This is some generic pretender.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Great another crappy DC movie. DC just needs to stop making movies it's really emberrasing at this point. The best DC movie is the one they have not made.
-_DJEzZk2pc,It seems like a nice walk past the edge of sanity! :)
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The worst thing about having a mental illness is,people expect you to behave as if you dont."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This movie is gonna be boring as shit. The backstory behind Joker sucks ass. The best parts are when he's already the Joker. This whole movie is about him becoming the Joker. Also, Joker didn't give a shit about anyone's feelings toward him. He became the Joker cause chemicals twisted him that way not the citizens of Gotham."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker is school shooter
-_DJEzZk2pc,"*Sees new joker*
Pshh whatever.
*Sees it is not a try hard this time*

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks pretty good, let's see how close he'll come to Ledger's Joker.
Cause let's be honest he ain't in Ledger's league. But then again, Nobody is."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin and a DC movie. Its gonna suck.
-_DJEzZk2pc,0:30 very emotional
-_DJEzZk2pc,Shout out to anyone who recognized Paper Boy and Vanessa
-_DJEzZk2pc,joker from suicide squad has to be my favorite
-_DJEzZk2pc,"DC now you have a perfect succesor for Heath ledger's joker.


Just give him those cheek stitches in the next movie. It will make him look more terrifying and mental"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Jared Leto: I'm the best Joker

Joaquin Phoenix: *Hold my beer*"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why can't I stop watching this amazing trailer?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Hey, God, it's me. I know I don't talk to you very much, but could you do me a solid and not make the Joker movie suck?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,No Batman!?!?! Well then forget it...
-_DJEzZk2pc,The Joker as an actual clown? Seriously?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dam this is gonna be good!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If, just if, his mother name also martha, i will laugh and become a joker myself"
-_DJEzZk2pc,H√≥ng
-_DJEzZk2pc,So I‚Äôm guessing this is going straight to dvd? Looks horrible
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Dogshit could play leto. Still, the joker is a dumb idea. I like the actor...but not the stupid juakin"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"finally my favorite joker., come to reality.  ARENA OF VALOR moba."
-_DJEzZk2pc,In parts of this trailer he really looked like Ty Burrell
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Not really digging the blue make-up around his eyes, but I still think he looks good."
-_DJEzZk2pc,this version of joker scares me to death
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Noone:

-_DJEzZk2pc,GAY!!

-_DJEzZk2pc,"He is good buuuuuut sadly Heath Ledger is for me the only true Joker :(
No Jared Leto? Well they learnd something because he was awful to watch :D"
-_DJEzZk2pc,this trailer gave me the creeps....i must go watch this movie lol
-_DJEzZk2pc,We live in a society the movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,hmm...joker better get kills
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is it a sequel to Her?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don‚Äôt like the makeup but this looks awesome
-_DJEzZk2pc,"When he delivers the line ""what?"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm not liking what I'm seeing so far.Phoenix is a fine actor,but he's just doesn't seem right for the part."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If there's one thing I hope people take away from this movie, it's to always, ALWAYS, do good to everyone. Because if you don't, you might help make someone into a real Joker! Like the one just around the corner. HAHAHAHAHA!!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"No one will ever compare to Heath Ledger's role as the Joker, but I'm definitely going to check this out."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This movie seems dark, and makes me feel sad....for a bad guy."
-_DJEzZk2pc,All the trailer showed was Joker getting his ass kicked
-_DJEzZk2pc,Jokr in 1989 mad from chemcal. Jokr today mad from sosity. Thums up plz.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This doesn't look like it's gonna be a good movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I wish I had a dollar for every mention of Heath Ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,Such is the society we love in
-_DJEzZk2pc,W
-_DJEzZk2pc,"only the music ist epic and then even the actor, yeah, 
see you in october"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I‚Äôm so excited to see something original come out of Hollywood for once! Finally a superhero movie. Clearly the age of creativity is upon us with yet another one of a kind, cookie cutter super hero movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Idk, Joker as a victim, lashing out? Almost has a SJW ring to it... we‚Äôll see"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I really just don‚Äôt want to know what made him into the Joker. One of my favorite parts of the character is not knowing anything about him
-_DJEzZk2pc,Too many jokers. Its a joke. Hollywood Bullshit. Fuck this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Comments seem to disagree, but I think this looks dull. Looks like a slow spin into insanity..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,If Heath Ledger was still alive he would fit perfectly into this role
-_DJEzZk2pc,"O se han reservado mucho y no han mostrado nada en el trailer o simplemente va a ser mala, espero lo primero."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Well that's a tv movie.waste of money
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's gonna be hard to do it better than Heth Ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,"oh man... i think i need to see this one first, then i will decide later on if  the cowl needs to be put on again.."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It would‚Äôve been cool if they got willam dafoe to play the joker, I think he would‚Äôve done a badass job"

-_DJEzZk2pc,gamers rise up
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks trash
-_DJEzZk2pc,Johnny Cash playing the Joker?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sympathizing with the bad guy...it‚Äôs been done to death üíÄ
-_DJEzZk2pc,"after i hear dragon force , joker is nothing more than clown ..."

-_DJEzZk2pc,Amazing!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This give me thrill.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sanity is overrated.
-_DJEzZk2pc,We want suicide squad one
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nothing beats the old joker!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath ledger's joker was averall better . the looks everything was on point
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like a shitty movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Unpopular take: this looks fucking dumb.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks amazing!! Takes guts to follow after the Heath Ledger performance!! I'm excited!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,At least is not the same joker in suicide squaad
-_DJEzZk2pc,Only 6% of the audience absolutely hate this üëç
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Most badass villan is back,he's loved by marvel also‚ù§‚ù§üî•üî•"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Don't know about this one
-_DJEzZk2pc,Smile
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally a movie again im gonna watch in cinema eventually
-_DJEzZk2pc,As William Shakespeare once said. Most tragedies are misunderstood comedies
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dunno about this
-_DJEzZk2pc,Did anyone realise how at the very start the women called him Arthur
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is the true Psycho we were looking for. Jack Nicholson‚Äôs was good, but not off the rails. Heath Ledgers was the best Joker in history, but they focused more on the criminal side and gave him no back story. Lettos joker was just a flop. This one looks truly deranged"
-_DJEzZk2pc,this seems like trash
-_DJEzZk2pc,"high hopes for this, hope it delivers."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"johnny cash is joker, 10/10"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel it‚Äôs a good way to bring mental awareness and depression to people who don‚Äôt know the effects of it
-_DJEzZk2pc,Still not as good as Nicholson
-_DJEzZk2pc,I want to like it........
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm fucking hyped for this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Although Heath ledger's take on the joker will never be matched this looks like it could be a masterpiece
-_DJEzZk2pc,A long drawn out mediocre soap opera about how the Joker became the joker! & people would probably actually pay to see this but unfortunately for the idiots  I think this is a spoof do to the fact it was not saturated in Bullsht CGI.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fuck yes
-_DJEzZk2pc,Trailer honestly sucks. Hope more exciting one comes soon
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where you put your attention is a prayer and will manifest in your life. Focus on the darkness and that's what will come back to you.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Its not about money its about sending a message. The N word message
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This really gave me chills. Looks like the birth of a real monster. No CGI or crazy effects. It's all about the the story. 
Phoenix is going to own this."
-_DJEzZk2pc,That laugh. Scary
-_DJEzZk2pc,Jared Leto is and will always be the worst joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Could be a real hoot. Looking forward to this! :)
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ah, a film for the collective pain-body."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm speaking in serious manner, no joking - what's the point of living, being a man, when You have to 'fake smile', hide Your feelings, pretend all the time? Making through the years and saving up for a stupid Porsche? Someting equally wortheless as a goal like that?  I'll gladly read a thought through answer."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Awful and boring
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So basically, after this movie and IT, being a clown is officially the worst profession one can choose in the 21st century..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Smile, and the world is yours.
Cry, and you are alone."
-_DJEzZk2pc,god i hope its rated R
-_DJEzZk2pc,0:10 Scariest smile in history of cinema.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Man... this is going to be another awesome version of The Joker. It doesn't take away from Heath Ledger's version. Heath Ledger took it to a whole new level when no one even knew what The Joker character could be... he instantly had our respect. Joaquin Phoenix is about to do the same...wow!! This will be awesome and we won't be able to give it a real comparison to Heath Ledger because Ledger didn't get his own movie... which would have been insane as well. This guy here is the right guy to bring the next Joker. The imagery, the music, his voice; the scene of him dancing on the steps. Wow...this will be a masterpiece."
-_DJEzZk2pc,It looks so good!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I have to wonder how dark this will be. Definitely Looking forward to it but its Joker, so DC it needs to be really twisted because hes a psychopath to say the least."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This, this looks interesting and good. I'm actually excited"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks bad but I'm trying to stay open minded though
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh I am so gonna watch this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Very existential
-_DJEzZk2pc,Cant wait to bootleg it..
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yesssssss
-_DJEzZk2pc,The worst part of having a mental illness is people expect you to behave like you DONT (with a smiley face in the O)
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Hey Jared, take some notes"
-_DJEzZk2pc,wE LivE iN A sOciETy
-_DJEzZk2pc,Origin story of joker that got joker insane was he got thrown in wat of chemicals and his pregnant wife was killed at the same day
-_DJEzZk2pc,We live in a society...
-_DJEzZk2pc,The one problem I have with this movie is the concept of a Joker Origin Story. He's supposed to be a mystery
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can‚Äôt wait for itü§©
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wtf in october
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like total crap.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Should‚Äôve used Jared Leto‚Äôs Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"SCREW HOLLYWOOD !!!! and all their no imagination remakes !¬†... your an idiot if you attend.... or, just an average American."
-_DJEzZk2pc,They chose him over Jared Leto ü§¨ü§¨
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not sure if I want this
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why did they mess up my fav DC Character of all time????
-_DJEzZk2pc,F in the chat for Jared Leto
-_DJEzZk2pc,This will be good with Phoenix in the lead role.
-_DJEzZk2pc,poor joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"What's with all the dislikes? Sure it's not canon, but it looks refreshing for a DC movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Even though I wanted this to be heath ledger I still believe he is the best joker but this movie better present the joker as a villain they better not change his character to some bullied victim and gets us to sympathize with him.. No he has to be EVIL and DARK just like the joker we all know.. If not I am not watching
-_DJEzZk2pc,‡∏´‡∏•‡∏≠‡∏ô
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks shity:( no cuts on his face..
-_DJEzZk2pc,There is a Oscar winner
-_DJEzZk2pc,"In all seriousness this trailer is amazing, it doesn‚Äôt reveal too much about the story, it has an amazing soundtrack, it gives us just the right amount of joker to understand him enough, doesn‚Äôt just portray him as an ultimately evil villain and let‚Äôs us us see he is a human, shows us what looks to be a great origin story and he finally has an actor that can play him well. RIP Heath"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie will be great
-_DJEzZk2pc,Vn
-_DJEzZk2pc,Well joker is at least one character they seem to cast pretty well.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nobody will ever do it better than Heath Ledger did period
-_DJEzZk2pc,I want the old joker back. Go home Ronald
-_DJEzZk2pc,This might actually be good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sooooo excited for this movie!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don‚Äôt know. I mean it‚Äôs miles better than the Leto version but I think Heath Ledger set the bar too high. I mean I‚Äôm still going to watch this but personally I‚Äôm not super hyped about it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I am very excited! :-)))
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Mega geil, alter freue ich mich"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Omg move on from the Joker...
-_DJEzZk2pc,if it isnt rated R its gonna suck
-_DJEzZk2pc,Johnny Cash has left the chat.
-_DJEzZk2pc,this is desrepiting Heath Ledger üò•
-_DJEzZk2pc,"He doesn‚Äôt seem badass or scary over here , trailer looks 4/10 but i have big expectations from this movie"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Memes
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Uh, this is gonna be good."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks. Awful.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why does Hollywood focus on cisgendered white men. This is deeply  problematic for our society
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'd bet money that someone kills his mom, and that pushes him over the edge."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"A la mierda las peliculas de plastico de Marvel, esto si que es arte. Ya, ya, ya. Era broma. Obviamente esta pelicula es otra categoria y no puede ser comparada, pero realmente me encanto. No puedo esperar a verla."

-_DJEzZk2pc,You see madness is like gravity. All it takes is a little push. :)
-_DJEzZk2pc,How did I just now got that the look is pretty much old school Joker from the series mixed with Heath Ledger's Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow!
-_DJEzZk2pc,So they're rewriting the history of Batman again what the f*** really ?  how many ways is it going to figure to reinvent the same f****** guy
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks so mediocre idk what everyone talking about comparing it to ledger ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
-_DJEzZk2pc,Good on you DC. Raking it in since marvel is too busy being a sjw league
-_DJEzZk2pc,The real Joker died a long time ago all those new ones are only a bad copy
-_DJEzZk2pc,We all want to be Batman but Joker is the one we can relate to the most... üÉè one bad day
-_DJEzZk2pc,I come here everday just to hear him laugh.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This trailer alone is better than the whole Suicide Squad fiasco
-_DJEzZk2pc,Batman is probably not gonna be in this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,I liked Joaquin in the gladiator as the villain I'm sure he'll prevail here.
-_DJEzZk2pc,the OG SJW
-_DJEzZk2pc,joquin phoenix is a hell of an actor. good choice.
-_DJEzZk2pc,We are expected to believe that this guy is a match for Batman lol. Just shoot him already!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"HAHAHAHAHAHAAH
I LIKE THIS GUY...  HE IS SO INTENSE!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can someone clarify what universe this takes place in for me? Is this the origin of the joker we see in SS or a completely different universe with a new joker?
-_DJEzZk2pc,He is not Heath Ledger.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Great actor bad writing.
-_DJEzZk2pc,lame af... society made joker.. okay sjws... social engineering again...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I respect Joaquin Phoenix as an actor. He is great,

but this movie did NOT need to be made. Why do DC and Marvel need to whip certain characters beyond death in an already over saturated library of their own making. If you start running out of fingers on one hand when counting how many actors you have used to portray a single character in the last 20 years, you know you have a problem."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Tossing the original joker orgin story out the window huh. I Didn't see any plot or motive except being looked down at for holding a sign.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The Joker we deserved
-_DJEzZk2pc,I thought I‚Äôll never see the day another epic Joker since Heath Ledger....this might be yet another Epic One!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"GAMERS, RISE UP!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This will be just like any other person to play Joker since Heath Ledger. When its announced everyone is hesitant, trailer comes out and everyone is stoked, movie comes out and everyone is disappointed. This same pattern would happen if anyone played Joker. Hell Snooki could be the next joker and it would follow this pattern lmao..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,based and honkpilled
-_DJEzZk2pc,dc famous for there villains
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks gay I expected better
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks amazing, hope he doesn't die after the movie comes out"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Since when was the joker not British and not intelligent, i mean i hope this dude has high functioning autism rain main and he‚Äôs part genius otherwise shit doesn‚Äôt make sense. 

Society made him do it wtf:"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Mark my words, this is going to be a flopüòí"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger and Jack Nicholson play the best joker in my opinion but this guy might be a close 3rd
-_DJEzZk2pc,Esto es lo mejor de DC en mucho tiempo!
-_DJEzZk2pc,""" that looked epic"" the American said. ""That looked utter shite"" said everyone else"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is going to be good

-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm excited for this movie, I was wondering how he was going to stack up to Jack...Looking good so far. Wondering if jumper cables will make an appearance somewhere in there?"

-_DJEzZk2pc,why?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I like that his make up is actual clown pattern from clown college, its just a small touch that shows he probably took his clown career very seriously. Actually studied the ancient techniques, the face paint, ect..."

-_DJEzZk2pc,Why so serious
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Folks, here's something darker than the Dark Knight

-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie is the answer to a question no one asked.    And one better left  alone
-_DJEzZk2pc,Seems like a weird film???
-_DJEzZk2pc,"SJWs get a hold of DC comics.  Riddler, the Penguin, Mr Freeze will all made by society now. Batman is now a beta male, Robin will be transgender, Batgirl is a lesbian, and everyone will protest and ‚Äúresist‚Äù commisioner Gordon üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ae  vi·ªát nam ƒë√¢u ƒëi·ªÉm danh
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks like ass. Or shit from a big fat sweaty ass that nobody wants to smell. 
This trailer isn't showing anything worth watching.
 A mommas boy/street clown that gets punked all the time is no comparison to Heath Ledger's joker or Jared Leto's Joker. 
This trailer is the soyboy version of the joker
üëéüëé"
-_DJEzZk2pc,ok this is fucking Dope.. Goosebumps
-_DJEzZk2pc,So Phil dumphey is now joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Onision was made for this role
-_DJEzZk2pc,This Joker looks older than my dad. ü§¢
-_DJEzZk2pc,That looks so bad lol
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Could be good, but my first impression...It looks so depressing that I think I'll wait for it on dvd. The fact that Batman isn't featured kinda takes the excitement out of it for me. Having those two characters in a story together is usually the big draw."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"How exciting, the same movie over, and over again."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Still, the only guy who can justify the role of Joker is Heath Ledger (according to me). You can disagree."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I am thinking if Batman will appear or not.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath ledger was the best joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"What a fucking boring movie, give me the old joker back from Suicide Squad... Worst movie of the year 10/10!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This will be a serious mistake any Yahoo out there with Mommy's makeup will think they're the Joker remember what happened to the Batman movie where the guy dressed up as Joker and shot all those kids in the movie theater we have to make Society realize the Joker is not a simple character you can just put on mommy's makeup and become I see a lot of deaths coming from this movie because of Mommy's makeup and not the chemical wash
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hey even compete with Heath..
-_DJEzZk2pc,So basically this movie is about a man who was trting to do good and make people smile but some dickheads kept fucking with him and made him self councouse and decided to go dark?
-_DJEzZk2pc,movie trailers arent supposed 2 make me cry :/ already love it
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks kinda lame.  Most overdone movie idea.  There will be a new joker in 5 years.  Come up with something new you brain dead twats
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movies is going to breed a bunch of know-it-alls that think they know the jokers origin story
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This Joker is the result of toxic society just like post WW1 but pre WW2 Weimar German getting f..ked, bullied left and right. The injustice and bullying made Germany snapped and led to the reign of horror by Adolf Hitler. This movie is a perfect depiction of People's Republic of China. After a Century of humiliation, they have risen from the graveyard and they're coming for you! Society is to blame, human is to blame. Everyone and every nation has a breaking point. The moral of the story: If we treat people just abit nicer, sh.t would not go down like this. This movie serves as a reminder to all."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"FUCK YA IM GONNA SEE THAT SHIT.WITH A SMILE ON 
AND STONE 
AND DRUNK."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Based on a true story




Actually happend"
-_DJEzZk2pc,gamers rise up
-_DJEzZk2pc,Unnecessary.
-_DJEzZk2pc,All it takes is the wrong ingredients at the right time of madness to create the Joker in you. No one alive is immune.
-_DJEzZk2pc,A must watch movie üòßüò¢
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ez egy fos
-_DJEzZk2pc,What's is the song name please?
-_DJEzZk2pc,edgy guys are going to be insufferable after watching this but god bless this trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,"heth ledger fan likeüëç here
love from India"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Que mala
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:09
-_DJEzZk2pc,Stupid
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Should've called the movie ""One Bad Day"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,Damn gangs of white men in suits running around terrorising everyone.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh my god. The insanity is beautiful in this trailer! üëè
-_DJEzZk2pc,We live in a society...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Only guy who can make an impact equal to heath's performance!!! Hoping story and taking would be great
-_DJEzZk2pc,Whoa! Is it possible to be as good as Ledger? Movie looks AMAZING.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Get ready for laughs!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I kinda see that they want us to empathize with him this time, him getting beat up and all, literally and figuratively by society. They really want us to wish he would just stand up for himself. If there ever is a romanticization of the Joker figure, this is probably it. We can see the origin, and it doesn't belong to a fictional world but a real one, a Gotham that feels more real than any other Gotham before. He could be any poor sob with an undiagnosed mental disorder, down on his luck. He could be any of us."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow!
-_DJEzZk2pc,So...the Joker is now just a skinny pussy who got 'picked on by society'? I feel sad for this generation!
-_DJEzZk2pc,My joker is 2008..
-_DJEzZk2pc,what the fuck is this shit?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Die Besetzung....einsame Spitze!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Meeeh, there is no joker without a batman. This obesseion with jokers nowadays...."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The jury's out. I'll wait and see, but it looks interesting and Joaquin Phoenix is a great actor."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Strange it looks great, because of the Acting. But also it looks not realy good, because of its backround. Joker its a Part of the DC Universe and so the Backround should fit in. So looks Strange, Good and Bad the same Time =)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this the movie or a trailer? It showed just about everything
-_DJEzZk2pc,A hairlipped reminder of what could have been....
-_DJEzZk2pc,Who else is living in a society and rising up against women and minorities in 2019? Bottom text
-_DJEzZk2pc,You know this movie was made just to compete with marvels venom movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Phil dunphy is that you?
-_DJEzZk2pc,i have a feeling this is about to be good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin Phoenix is literally in the TOP 3 of a shortlist of the BEST POSSIBLE ACTORS we could have gotten to play The Joker in a new movie.  Seriously - if you're going to choose a prestigious and accomplished actor who has a reputation for being FUCKING INSANE, you could not do much better than Joaquin Phoenix.  Does anyone else remember that he applied such a tremendous degree of commitment and reality to the film ""I'm Still Here"", which was a slightly overbaked (in the stoner sense) post-modern comment on the corrosive effect of media and pop culture, that people were legitimately concerned about his mental health and well-being.  I think that speaks volumes, to a degree.

I really can't think of many actors who would be better than Phoenix - he's definitely the best choice of anyone who is 40 or older.  Looking at younger actors, the only one who TRULY pops out as being able to do that role is Adam Driver - he's the kind of guy who could really rip his teeth into a role like that.  But he's in a sort of similar place (in terms of career and life) to where Heath Ledger was when he did the role, and I wouldn't fault him for avoiding the role; besides, he's getting tons of work anyway."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Am I the only one who gets a good laugh out of The Joker getting beat up on public transportation by 3 white guys in suits?  There is a reason BART refuses to publish videos of train violence: they don‚Äôt want us to see all the white guys in suits beating people up.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Perfect part for him, he has such an incredible range, this suits him. 
  Kinda like the first Christian Bale Batman, dark and brooding. Finally we get the real backstory. Can't wait!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Glad they casted an actor who can actually capture the disturbing craziness of the Joker, not that crap Leto pulled in suicide squad."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Honestly have no idea if this is going to be great or terrible.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I know everyone likes to see a good joker but thier is about a ....5% chance this man doesn't either go crazy or die of malnutrition... Or both
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Say goodbye Ledger, best joker is about to come

**lEdGeR iS tHe bEsT jOkER**"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks so so so fucking good
-_DJEzZk2pc,Great choice for the joker. He's become one of my favorites over the years.
-_DJEzZk2pc,You can hear the sucking sound that's how bad this movie will be.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Plot Twist: this movie is the real prequel to the Dark Knight.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow...this is something else !,  think I gonna like this version of THE Joker..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,We want heath back
-_DJEzZk2pc,Zazie Beets is in it. That's enough reason for me to see it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Still miss him
-_DJEzZk2pc,Netflix?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Umm *Suicide Squad* is much better
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks rubbish , Cesar Romero will be spinning in his grave !"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Will there be killing in the movie? Does Joker go on a killing spree? Or this just about how Joker came to be?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I want my Jared Leto Joker movie...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Idk what you people are saying but the trailer gave me goosebumps , i'm gonna watch it 1000% in cinemas no matter how good or bad it is ."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Might be dc‚Äôs first good movie and it also doesn‚Äôt have cgi. Wow just wow
-_DJEzZk2pc,What a joke
-_DJEzZk2pc,we live in a soceity
-_DJEzZk2pc,I know this is just the trailer but I feel like this might be too much of a departure from the Character. This felt more more along the lines of the pursuit of happiness but the creator didn't know if they wanted it to be a happy or sad ending. Really confusing imo and just weird idk how to explain.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Remake of 1960s movie Mera Naam Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,looks so shit....
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wonder how long after this movie will he get in a funk and off himself like Heath did!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where is batman
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looking like a social Justice warrior....
-_DJEzZk2pc,when does Dc stops to produce joker films ? they have so much to show but it`s ust to much much from Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,About time DC Luv u so much
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is he a gamer tho?
-_DJEzZk2pc,ABSOLUTELY NONSENSE
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Finally, a movie I actually look forward to."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Rafael Phoenix brilliant brilliant actor. But he is looking very old at  44
-_DJEzZk2pc,Same ole' super hero shit!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I bet it‚Äôs just my thoughts but some of the comments on here look like paid comments to praise the movie  üëÄ
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is it,please win grammy"
-_DJEzZk2pc,They shouldn‚Äôt have revealed his name and backstory it just ruin the jokers mystery smh
-_DJEzZk2pc,They have money they could of hire anyone but they get this idiot.
-_DJEzZk2pc,i think  is great the older joker take looks great lets be honest a deranged 40 yo makes more sense then s1 the same age as bruce killing the waynes
-_DJEzZk2pc,not a good look Mr arizona
-_DJEzZk2pc,The best trailer. I ever see...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dumb
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I can‚Äôt stand constant reboots. 

Worthy however, of the Bale Batman 

Can‚Äôt imagine this being integrated with the current Justice League franchise."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I never get tired of watching this. My god it looks spectacular ! They've got the essence of the joker character that a lot of people when portraying him miss.. the true sadness behind him. 
Don't let us down DC ! Redeem yourselves !"
-_DJEzZk2pc,B O T T O M    T E X T
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why not the purple suit. It would have been so much better with the purple suit
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So...this looks like joker is good guy who's been bullied for smiling and laughing?....

Sniff sniff üò•üòñ"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Warner bros/marvel films are for white dysfunctional weirdos...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks horrible. He‚Äôs not even insanely clever, he‚Äôs just weak"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ok, no more after this one."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Marvel?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Its look shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's about time we get a proper anti-hero in superhero movies.  No special effects needed. Just great writing and acting. Please don't fuck this up DC.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Brilliant! The fanboys will eat this shit up even if the movie is as boring as the trailer.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Shit, this looks good"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is that Deniro at 2:00?  Nobody‚Äôs going to mention that?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joken Phoenix
-_DJEzZk2pc,this movie has no taste and will not beat heath ledger whats the point of this  ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie looks bad...he not the joker not even the right makeup so wtf
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm interested
-_DJEzZk2pc,In the beginning he is going up a flight of stairs it means he is start to realize that it may not be so good after all. So at the end when he is going down happy the stairs symbolize his sanity so he is losing he mind but loving ever second of it
-_DJEzZk2pc,"On a second thought, I think I'm going to like DC this time"
-_DJEzZk2pc,You laugh you lose joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,If they dont put the part where joker fell in a chemical accident that made him the *Joker* then this movie is a dissapointment
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks so goood!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,After Heath ledger.  I will never take another joker seriously
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks fucking awsome
-_DJEzZk2pc,I always think of post op white Michael Jackson when I think of DCs Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The make up is so much
-_DJEzZk2pc,They should use this movie as a foundation to reboot Batman
-_DJEzZk2pc,100% DC will ruin the movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,This feels on the same level as Jack Nicholson
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:53 i used to think my life is a tragedy but now i realise it's comedy..
-_DJEzZk2pc,–ø–æ—Ö–æ–¥—É –Ω–µ —Ñ–∏–ª—å–º –∞ –≥–æ–≤–Ω–æ –±—É–¥–µ—Ç
-_DJEzZk2pc,"and yet another fuckup from dc, why dont they just give up and die with a little dignety. Nobody with any form of intelligence or smarts will ever like disney's true (dark) side. Shitty movie, shitty concept and even shittier creators. Watch this in the theaters and know you will forever be a loser"
-_DJEzZk2pc,The first DC movie I'm excited to watch
-_DJEzZk2pc,Plot twist: *the movie is a comedy.*
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Goodbye Jared Leto/suicide squad and your vanilla ice joker this is THE JOKER....
Heath ledger set the mark and now Joaquin Phoenix has done it! Nobody will compare to ledgers joker but Joaquin Phoenix from first impressions has done the character justice giving us a Joker that fans can relate to and will no doubt surprise us at the same time cant wait to see the film"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"1940s: Modernism -- man without faith loses his mind and becomes criminally insane. Villain.
2010s: Post-Modernism--man without faith loses his mind and becomes criminally insane. Hero. 

The bad guy is actually the good guy. The fictional bad guy justifies all the SJW hatred for the world. The world is a horror, so the hero must be even more horrific. 

When people began to believe that good would no longer prevail, our civilization began its slow death."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Absolutely perfect casting
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this real or that fake trailer shit it's hard to believe anything on youtube
-_DJEzZk2pc,I want ti know how did he get that one scar.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow....a contender to 'the dark knight ' joker, better than 'suicide squad' poser one."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Damn.. movie looks like straight shit..
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC movies be all over the place they to organize like marvel
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I LIKE DC 
from Indonesian üëç"
-_DJEzZk2pc,No disrespect towards Heath Ledger but I think Joaquin Phoenix will completely change the way we perceive acting.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally a story of a villain
-_DJEzZk2pc,Batman is gonna save the day.. probably..
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I don't know if any joker will ever surpass Heath Ledgers, but this man is in with a real shot. Soo excited!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,now they see...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why is he soooo old it's supposed to be the start of joker right ???? His younger in every movie before this üòï
-_DJEzZk2pc,"DC, you haven't given me any reason to suspect you are capable of making a competent super hero/villain movie anymore, but this trailer has made my body ready for this movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Batman could kick his ass!!! He as skinny as a celery stick bruh!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This just looks terrible... it might have been a good movie if it wasn't supposed to be the Joker's back story... but DC has again ruined a character...
-_DJEzZk2pc,man this new payday sequel looks great!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Man, I don‚Äôt know, this looks avant-garde as hell, and not in a good way."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Seems like a nice guy
-_DJEzZk2pc,I heard he was playing Joker and was like...meh. Until I seen this trailer and now I‚Äôm like....wow.
-_DJEzZk2pc,R.I.P Heath Ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,"another comic book character movie that wont be attached to any hero story. its just like venom. sigh, probably no reference to batman at all........"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nope. Hard pass.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I just can't wait to see this...

After this probably joker will be grown ups' hero"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh yarshish I cant wait
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nah...I like Jack Nicholson the best....
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Oscar's , here we go"
-_DJEzZk2pc,i thought the joker is Alfred
-_DJEzZk2pc,So he Just snapt
-_DJEzZk2pc,Smile cause the world doesn't want you to.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"No No No This is so stupid, this is not the timeline of the real Joker, Joker killed his Mother when he was a kid, and his name was Jerome Valeska...."
-_DJEzZk2pc,The Problem with every Joker Movie is that NO ONE will ever be as good as Heath Ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I mean i haven‚Äôt seen the movie, but joker as a character was always so great because we didn‚Äôt know his origins for example in The Dark Knight the joker told 3 different stories about his scars for confusion of the audience. Long story short the joker was always untouchable and not relatable, so by creating an origin story the  mystique behind his character is lost. But thats just my opinion"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY VERONICA, ONLY US GAMERS UNDERSTAND"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Did dc gave up on the heroes or why do they have to make movies about supervillains? Like suicide squad ok some of them are still a bit good hearted but joker? He's lost...
-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôm confused?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks dumb
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Honestly, it's still too soon."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is incredible, can't wait to watch it because it portrays the message that society is prejudice and will impact the ones who don't deserve to suffer"
-_DJEzZk2pc,What the fuck is this shit ?!?!?!?!?!?!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks fucking stupid. i'll pass
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger is smilling in heaven watching this
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Society is worse than chemicals. 
Seems legit"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Overrated The Movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,A very beauty film to explain this character
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Society is so toxic now, it made the joker..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Can it be? Can we have a movie about comic book character without CGI, mindless explosions and all other cliches?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I get the story but this seems trash to me
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I might be speaking for myself but I think this is going to be a total flop. I thought the jokers dad cut his mouth when he was young so he would always smile, and I don‚Äôt really see anything about him being a villain in the trailer. I probably will never watch this. It‚Äôs a little disappointing."
-_DJEzZk2pc,dceu should have never existed (zack synder sucks). this is what the fans want
-_DJEzZk2pc,"DC are doing some pretty good movies lately without following a formula. Each seems a brilliant, unique movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally a good DC movie like Batman begins.. Im sick of all those marvel movies in theaters!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think all the Joker's were good in their own way. But then again I've always been a huge fan of the villains and never cared too much for superhero queers
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Meh, I'm not impressed"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"*thinks his life is a comedy*






Boi don't you realize how many people you killed"
-_DJEzZk2pc,He can be the maestro. Watching this movie 120%
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow
-_DJEzZk2pc,Anyone who like this is not a real comic book fan and is young ass fuck... This is a disgrace to the Joker...
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC pulling their finger out!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope this doesn't end up being the same thing as Venom where the lead actor is great (Hardy / Phoenix) but the movie is a letdown.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Never would i have been interested in a joker movie... until now.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""You're all just one bad day from being me."" - The Killing Joke."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Batman is relateable coz its not fiction ...its very society we live in.....
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger was the best JOKER
-_DJEzZk2pc,Your mission ? Make Jared Leto a far away dream.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Holy shit this actually looks good
-_DJEzZk2pc,"WTF!!! Legit just last night while I was laying down in bed I thought to myself (if they haven't already) they really fucking badly need to make a Joker Origins movie aye!! I was even gonna write it down but couldn't be fucked to do so in the end but that's how good of an idea that was to me aye & then bang I see this trailer tonight aye hooooooly shit!! Like Joker is one of the best and is my favourite characters out of the entire DC/Marvel universes & every other character from both of them universes are getting there own movie's like eg: Shazam, Deadpool 1&2!, Aquaman, Antman & The Wasp, Teen Titans (yes it is a TV series & not a movie but it still counts), Captain Marvel, Black Panther & etc. Don't get me wrong I still love all those characters & movies but all I'm saying is what took them so long!! RIP Heath Leadger!! So sad that he won't get to play the Joker again you were taken way too young mate you bloody legend :) :'( >:("
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh this movie is gonna be good
-_DJEzZk2pc,Lame.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"People always think the next DC movie is gonna be good, but it never is. Do people learn?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gamers have been put down by society too long. We live in a society. Epic
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Should be called, ""The Crack Head""!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,It reminds me of heathlesher every time he walks through the hall may he Rest In Peace
-_DJEzZk2pc,So the joker didn‚Äôt fall into chemicals which made him insane?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Marvel is better
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don't mind all the different jokers as long as they do a good job.  I think Jared Leto is my least favorite. Hopefully this is as good as it looks.
-_DJEzZk2pc,:We live in a society... no wait i live in a society fuck.
-_DJEzZk2pc,They gonna try make the joker sympathetic... fuck it I quit.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Will be a 5 star film
-_DJEzZk2pc,bu ne bi√ßim joker b√∂yle joker mi olur aq
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hey any day with Zazie Beets will turn my frown  into a smile. Why so serious?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"My spare time:Playing fortnite
Joker's spare time:Laughing in clown costumes in a subway and getting beat up"
-_DJEzZk2pc,First impression is not good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath ledger did it better
-_DJEzZk2pc,Lol they might actually do something right for once
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh my fucking gosh I can‚Äôt wait
-_DJEzZk2pc,Well done DC way to fuk up a great thing with that bad acting loser.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"To much origins, not enough joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Spider-Man into the verse makers should make an animated joker movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm sick of Ledger tryhard, disrespectful fanboys. They think no other film art exists besides that film. No other actors are great, etc. Phoenix is one of the 5 greatest of the last decade. If you didn't see his performance in THE MASTER you don't know what you are talking about. Not even Ledger has done a performance like that."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Life is a joke
-_DJEzZk2pc,Another movie we didn't ask for
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Blah blah blah.... Pass on the guided by hard times turned into a psychopathic killer adaptation of this. Bad shit happens to everyone, why do we have to sympathize with a serial
killer?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Still best joker is ..... you now it
-_DJEzZk2pc,"A joker movie without batman? No thank you
Plus he is supposed to become the joker because of ""one bad day"" not that society bullshit"
-_DJEzZk2pc,0:55 is that domino ??
-_DJEzZk2pc,I reckon this will be good
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think the characterisation is excellent... I just don't want a joker origin story
-_DJEzZk2pc,Christian bale laugh at 1:09
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix was the only person in the Hollywood  who could play joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I've always thought joker sucks until I saw this........ I'm his fan now
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not saying this guy is a shit actor or anything but when I watch this it'll b hard not compare to Heath Ledger Joker R. I. P Heath
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This looks to be an authentic exploration of the joker's character and how minor quirks and insecurities can be exaggerated and turned negative by society's poor treatment of those that sit on the periphery. But apparently there's a lot of simpletons obsessed with how this links to other films, and those who have put Ledger on a pedestal purely because of his untimely death. Open your narrow minds to something different...."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks terrible
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks pretty lame tbh..
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fuck this film!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Phoenix always has been one of my favorite actors, he really dissociates from himself to delv into his characters role almost completely. Just like Ledger. That alone is enough for me. I‚Äôm sold."
-_DJEzZk2pc,LOL THIS JOKER I SO FAKIN LAMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ONE LEDGER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,why so serious Ôºü
-_DJEzZk2pc,wow a new movie that actually looks...good ^^
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I have ONE problem with this movie.
The Joker is Jack Napier..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Phoenix Don't Joke around ....
-_DJEzZk2pc,RIP KETH LEDGER
-_DJEzZk2pc,best joker ever!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"LOVE THIS MUSIC SO FUCKING MUCH
fits in with the theme if the movie"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel sorry for Joaqu√≠n now that I know his background story
-_DJEzZk2pc,Director best known for comedies. Makes Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix is the perfect actor for the role. Trailer looks great!
-_DJEzZk2pc,the epic gamer movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,RIP Heath Ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is that vegan warrior?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath might be proud about this
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow... this got me in shock. This movie can even get an oscar... if Black Panther did, this one should get at least 4."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Anyone else look at his face with unfocused eyes @2:21??  Extra creepy.  Very Skeletal.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why so serious?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can't they just CGI Heath Ledger into this and adjust his voice. It would be awesome
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks stupid as fuck
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not interested.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I have a feeling this will be the masterpiece we've always wanted but never get a sequel for.  Something like ""Taxi Driver""."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Holy shit!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Great trailer. Let¬¥s hope it¬¥s not like Suicide Squad¬¥s greatness of it¬¥s misleading trailer.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Flop

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Norman Bates, is that you?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Despite my fear of clowns, the message here is good"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"They are overdoing it. The Batman franchise is becoming more and more twisted out of context. They discovered the Joker has the potential to be a social outcast character who becomes the antihero due to society. It's a literal product of the actual society. Big Izz said it below; Back in 89, Joker was made from Chems. Now, he is made from society.

Imagine; real life society get entertainment from the fact that someone turns villain due to the society treating them like shit. Mean while REALLIFE, more and more mental and personality disorders, are are popping up and it only gets worse."

-_DJEzZk2pc,Recycled fucking bullshit.¬† Fuck you Hollywood pedo cunts.
-_DJEzZk2pc,But didn‚Äôt jokey dad cutter his mouth cause he was laughing or something
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ledger was a good actor, but that‚Äôs not Joaquin Phoenix.  that‚Äôs the joker coming in to play as himself."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"After ""irrational man"" ,im very into this actor"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""What kind of coward would do something that coldblodded, someone who hides behind a mask""
Maybe this is the killing of Bruce Waynes parents. It also shows the Joker with a gun, maybe the weapon. Maybe the boy in this trailer is Bruce Wayne as a child, after or before his parents were killed."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks good, though they messed up his origin story, again. 
That's why I hate those DC and Marvel things, always changing stories..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is not gonna turn out good i gues.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The joker isn‚Äôt a good person wasn‚Äôt a clown his transformation in this makes the joker look weak anybody that knows batman films series that the joker isn‚Äôt weak
-_DJEzZk2pc,Tragedies in Life.. bullied.... The Joker Is Born......
-_DJEzZk2pc,I want watch this film
-_DJEzZk2pc,The reason why i prefer dc over marvel
-_DJEzZk2pc,"actually , it looks good"
-_DJEzZk2pc,i think this is going to be my favorite movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Not gonna happen but hopefully this shuts down Ledger. If he hadn't died, no one would have given a fuck like they did with his performance. It was good but not the greatest shit like everyone spouts."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"WOW.    UNBELIEVABLE.   clearly a masterpiece of vision. pitching this must have been amazing to hear

(and stop dissing on Jared people, he did what he was told to do - and he did good by that)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wtf is this 







Edit:I came here to see joker not to learn the fucking meaning of life !

You can tell already this movie is going to be boring !

How the hell do u turn a psychopath to some type of art ?

üòí boy they really messed up this time"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fucking chills man. This does look good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gamers we must rise up
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Omg this is darkkkk and looks amazing. 


Shows you what fucking assholes can do to people 

Be good to one another"
-_DJEzZk2pc,with proper prep I can reserve a good seat.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Thiiiiiiis is so bad
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dumb
-_DJEzZk2pc,So is Joker killing Martha and Thomas Wayne?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is to show what todays society is, in its full toxic glory.
Rejoice, for this is not just a movie, its a prelude to our true selves. 
This is the worlds legacy, to die a violent death."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Joker's bizarre adventure.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can't wait for it!
-_DJEzZk2pc,maybe the chemical goes in a sequel movie. but the piano sound remembers me man of steel.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Okay, that actually looks petty good. I might go see it. But I'll be disappointed if there's no Harley!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,The music at 1:50 to 2:05 is like complete eat candy to me
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Sees joaquin phoenix in title






*already hooked*"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Came to mke a society joke, stayed because this looks incredible"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"this is either going to be really good or fucking terrible, no in-between"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is not the joker that i expected. This movie makes you feel bad about him instead of the other movies.üòû
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why so serious
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not feeling this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Heath Ledger still difficult to copy,but this one is good..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Well, I wouldn't mind seeing a Joker movie, but this aint it! Doesn't seem like the Joker would start out as a pussy? It doesn't fit in with Heaths Joker? If he Doesn't eventually become that Joker, I would be disappointed! Great performance of course, however, the Joker we all love has a deformed face along with the make-up? Looks like a me against the world person who became a clown?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Am i the only one that didn't like the fact that they gave an explanation to the birth of joker? I loved the heath ledger joker, that had no reason to do what he did, no one knew who he was, why he had that scars, and how he knew everything about everyone"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Anyone knows the name of the song that starts after 1'.30 """
-_DJEzZk2pc,"1:15
The expression on his face sold me.  See you guys in the Theatre."
-_DJEzZk2pc,The actor is so good
-_DJEzZk2pc,What worries me is the transformation most likely takes 95% of the film and we only get 5% true Joker antics. Sometimes these origin stories dwell on mundane things too long just to draw it out.
-_DJEzZk2pc,So is Batman gonna whoop his ass??
-_DJEzZk2pc,Strange this look like a normal movie not comics in motion like most of this types of film.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The cast from Atlanta is a nice touch
-_DJEzZk2pc,Could be the best we had since Heath
-_DJEzZk2pc,BIG SMILE
-_DJEzZk2pc,you nailed it mr.phoenix!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope they also make a Harley Quinn standalone film in the future
-_DJEzZk2pc,hmmm. I'm actually very disappointed
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sweet can't wait. Looks like the joker I've been waiting for since Heath Ledger. Great actor.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow that looks like complete garbage. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not going to lie... I‚Äôm intrigued
-_DJEzZk2pc,He's In smash too
-_DJEzZk2pc,That motherfucking joker walk üëå
-_DJEzZk2pc,"this is going to be shit. turning the Joker into something he's not, smh"
-_DJEzZk2pc,That looks boring and not really interesting
-_DJEzZk2pc,"bad stuff happened to me
really bad events
its okay for me to payback
awwwww ü§ó
thats some chick logic"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like it's gonna suck
-_DJEzZk2pc,"*Which one would you choose: Saving the world one at a time? Or cleanse all evil in an instant?*
Choose carefully...we're all Jokers deep inside"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Some things don't get better if people try to explain them. Maybe we should just except some mystery around the Joker. Especially not if your terrible movie sucks all the coolness out of an iconic character to the point where you just have pity with him. How is this shit getting upvoted like crazy?1
-_DJEzZk2pc,now that's dark.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wtf is that shit ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now i know....batman is an idiot....joker is real life hero....
-_DJEzZk2pc,Batman should have not beat his ars a million times
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please let this be some kind of april fools joke lmao
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yeaaaaah.....still not sure about this one...
-_DJEzZk2pc,And the next Oscar goes to
-_DJEzZk2pc,I uhh.. I don't feel comfortable right now
-_DJEzZk2pc,This trailer was made by gang weed
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks really stupid
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks bad ass!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I used to think that my life was a tragedy.. But now I realized its a comedy.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Bad bad bad. Is this joker? Joker is white man with purple suit after he fell to chemicals. And this is stupid clown with red suit who became crazy after he was hit to head by some piece of wood.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I love it I personally think this universe where the joker is made up from society it self is brilliant idea i hope DC finally makes a good film. My Hope's are high. Smile,cus it confuses people Smile cus it's easier to than explaining why you hurt on the inside"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hes not a villain
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope there is no batman in it because that would just be same old thing with a new actors. Suicide squad nailed it with their batman scene.
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC fucks everything up.. Last great movie they had was Dark Knight smfh .. R.I.P Heath Ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,Does the joker do anything in this movie besides ride the subway and get knocked out?
-_DJEzZk2pc,A GOOD DC movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Some of this looks heart breaking, wasn't expecting that"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Legendary shit!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is it just  me or do We Live In A Society?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Hmmmmm idk, part of the joker has always been his obscure past and his idea that one bad day is all it takes to turn a perfectly normal person into a monster, don‚Äôt get me wrong this is probably going to be an excellent portrayal of how a mental illness tied with the depravity of a society and how these factors can make a good man a monster, but that seems different then the joker idk"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Props to dc. Marvel can‚Äôt make a villain movie like this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Taxi Driver meets Batman. Love it
-_DJEzZk2pc,you're in trouble now üç≠
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC = shit movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin is my babe, i don‚Äôt care that he is 40 year older than me but one thing is true, he was fucking hot when he was Young"
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC...should stick to doing major villains...
-_DJEzZk2pc,The next US president in the making!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I never understood all the hype of Heath Leagers version of the joker. This on the other hand seem truly great. This Joker comes from being an outcast, loneliness and frustration on the society."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I just wish mark Hamal would have gotten the role of a live action joker he is the best voice of the joker by far and he definitely could (maybe not now) have pulled the look off flawlessly real missed opportunity
-_DJEzZk2pc,Bullshit
-_DJEzZk2pc,We LiVe In A sOcIeTy
-_DJEzZk2pc,Here's when people start comparing Jared leto To Phoenix
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The people are so mean, why they need to beat him all the time...that's why he meant to be a joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker is nothing without Batman...Batman is nothing without Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Rip: Heath Ledger.
I thought he was the BEST joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks gay
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is either going to be really fuckin good or really fuckin bad.. I don't see any inbetween. Not really sure what to think about this one!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Shitttüòçüñ§
-_DJEzZk2pc,No villain in any movie can come close to heath ledgers joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Im having a really ""wicked disney movie"" feels"
-_DJEzZk2pc,finaly good jokerüò¢üòÇüò≠üòà
-_DJEzZk2pc,Cant wait! Does this mean commissioner gordon will be the good guy?
-_DJEzZk2pc,If you ever get jumped by a couple of faggot ass suits oh man just go home those guys pay black men to fuck their wives bc their small dicks cant
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I guess, still better than the Joker in Suicide Squad"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow. A DC film that looks like an actual film, could this be first good DC film since Nolan?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks good. Just makes me wonder how the hell do you make a whole film all about joker an not include batman. I mean, what the ending gonna be joker vs. Sgt. Bullock or Renee Montoya in the last fight."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Perhaps the best thing about this trailer - don't see the violence he's capable of - yet.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where is thanos?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath  ledger   is  very best  joker  role    R.I.P
-_DJEzZk2pc,I am impressed.If this trailer is similair to the movie it will not be really focused around action or the like like most DC movies but on social issues. That is a good sign. Honestly this is possibly the best way for a Joker origin story to be explored. As a reflection of what soceity can do to a person.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This will be boring because it's the beginning. Just like Fear of the walking Dead. It's the second one I can't wait to see.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This Joker is having bad day, everyday üòÇ"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"He‚Äôs great as always, but just imagine what Daniel Day Lewis would‚Äôve done with this.
We would have had another ‚ÄúJaws‚Äù situation on our handsüò±üôÄ"
-_DJEzZk2pc,this sounds like v for vendetta
-_DJEzZk2pc,Jaoquine.. The Legend!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Jack Nicholson is a crazy joker
Heath ledger is a scary joker
Jared Leto is a stupid joker
Joaquin is a sad joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Jack Nicholson is a crazy joker
Heath ledger is a scary joker
Jared Leto is a stupid joker
Joaquin is a sad joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,A DC movie thats not dark. Awesome
-_DJEzZk2pc,I doubt anyone will play a better joker than heath ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,That looks pretty good :0
-_DJEzZk2pc,Holy.Shit! This will suck ass.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks incredible.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hate the use of the music because it is a famous song by Charles Chaplin to encourage people to smile and have genuine joy in their hearts.  I hate that this beautiful song is married to a movie about a psychopathic killer.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can someone knock me out until October
-_DJEzZk2pc,Isn‚Äôt this whole thing wrong?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Okay it's a trailer, OK we can't really know, but that doesn't look like the the joker became the joker. I'm mean, redhood and shit?? 'member?

It' s still look like a good movie tho"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'll bet you the gun he pulls the trigger back on is the gun he uses to kill Bruce Wayne's parents with.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Also check out 'Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot' and 'You Were Never Really There' among others. He never does a bad performance, does he? In the latter, you may see some of his frustration that convinced somebody to make him the Joker. There is a scene with him and presumably his mother in this trailer. Looks like it's straight out of 'You Were Never Really Here'. And yes, 'The Master' is just one more exhibtion of his goddamn amazing acting. (Also, I can't really recommend the two movies I just mentioned to anybody... they are not happy films. But he. Is. Amazing in them... as always. In fifty years, he will be the cinematic god that wasn't rightfully acknowledged during his lifetime. Even Heath had a huge following before is unfortunate and suspicious demise."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks very promising.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This shit LIT
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks great. Phoenix is an underrated talent. I'm watching.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Theodore really let himself go after Samantha left... sad.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This movie is totally something I‚Äôll watch, never. The Joker is nothing more than a blatant rip off to make money for the studio and I‚Äôm surprised Joaquin Phoenix agreed to star in it. Though truth be told his career sucked before this movie so no gain not loss right."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks lame. Next
-_DJEzZk2pc,"can't believe, after heath, but now it seems they will pull it off..........waiting for it........"
-_DJEzZk2pc,The joker is getting more and more shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,We truly do live in a society
-_DJEzZk2pc,can you believe its been 11 years since heath died
-_DJEzZk2pc,boring...
-_DJEzZk2pc,trailer showed the whole movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Best movies to see in 2019:
1. Dark Phoenix
2. Joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,looks shitty
-_DJEzZk2pc,Beutifull
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nope
-_DJEzZk2pc,Here's the film that is going to convert Marvel fans into DC fans.üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ Smile!üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
-_DJEzZk2pc,"A Joker without Heath Ledger playing the role, No thank you, i will not ruin his memory!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,The Joker From Suicide Squad is a Joke. This one is the real deal
-_DJEzZk2pc,Goosebumps from 02:08
-_DJEzZk2pc,"looking good; it's Phoenix, so it's definitely going to be interesting. I prefer Ledger's clown makeup but Phoenix's face is definitely closer to the comics."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Anyone else besides me prefer this over the Marvel movies?
-_DJEzZk2pc,We all know heath ledger was top of the bill but this comes very close I think
-_DJEzZk2pc,Actually looks promising from what I see here.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""I used to think my life is a tragerdy.. But now I realized it's a comedy.""



Consequences~!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,He was perfect for this role.. He's gonna get an Oscar for this Im sure
-_DJEzZk2pc,A trailer that doesn't explain the intire plot? Well that's refreshing
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This says alot about our society, gamers rise up.
THIS COMMENT WAS MADE BY GANG WEED"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not original joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,They all die
-_DJEzZk2pc,today I'm watching it again
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Kind of looks inspired by the killing joke comic. It doesn‚Äôt look like something I would enjoy, but it looks like it could be a good movie if you‚Äôre into that kind of thing."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Man I expected a lot more this is so bad
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks absolutely crap will wait till it comes on the TV lol
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow. How bad does this look! Next a sad clown. Hard pass from me
-_DJEzZk2pc,now we get to know where joker came from
-_DJEzZk2pc,Well we know one more actor who will be dead soon.
-_DJEzZk2pc,boy i cant wait for the summer to fly by already...
-_DJEzZk2pc,The MCU makes movies that are more geared for middle america but this looks like it is more for people with discriminating taste. This could be the best portrayal of the Joker yet! I will definitely buy a ticket to see this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC-> DARK COMEDY
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally! A stable Canon origin story for the joker! An actual name for him! A movie Dedicated to the greatest villian in comic history! Alelujah!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joker's mother is mentally ill and is usually in the mental hospital as shown. Joker does many odd jobs very likely a stand up comedian based on his origins to make ends meet for himself and his mother. His life is complete dog shit and the only thing keeping is going is his mother. The staff kill her for some reason who knows but tell him it was an accident or miscalculation, Joker is too smart for that and finally loses his shit. Is that close enough?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Meh
-_DJEzZk2pc,This the dad from 13 reasons why?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Holy shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Holy pagliaccio, Batman!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Stop wanking to heath, his joker was over done and over rated and Not accurate, he died and got an Oscar for it. That's the cold fact."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks so much like heaths joker in the reflection at 1:37
-_DJEzZk2pc,is this a joke? i mean if it is you missed releasing it on april 1st by two days... damn DC management
-_DJEzZk2pc,Love Phoenix but hate that people need to spoil the Joker by finding out how he became like that. It's much more satisfying to not know his background and for him to be a complete mystery
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I actually like this Joker more than the others. He possesses a relatable,  tragic, and human aspect that isn't present in his counterparts. It made me both smile and cry... as one would to the bittersweetness of life."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Phil dumphy?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Stop fucking showing bones in the back that shit ain't cute.
-_DJEzZk2pc,wow....the trailer looks good... a trailer without any superhero or VFX looks good ... seems DC is finally realizing that character development is more important even in superhero movies. And this JOKER looks good... !!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"They totaly fucked up the original story behind the joker... 
Another film that will ruin the reputation of the actual original character..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I never thought that I could see a better joker performance of the Joker after Heath, but Joaquin Phoenix is a master and if the movie is as good as the trailer, we have an oscar performance in sight!!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Meh.
-_DJEzZk2pc,is this joke?
-_DJEzZk2pc,No offense to jared letto but I really didn't like his version of joker this one reminds a bit of heath ledgers joker which I think was the best I have high hopes for this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,My goodness this is going to be fucking awesome
-_DJEzZk2pc,oscar 2020 ??? this looks amazing
-_DJEzZk2pc,This Looks pretty good to be honest
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks bad tbh
-_DJEzZk2pc,"ok people i dont know what the fuck ye talking about this noting to do the joker  now dont start did i read the comics and i cant rembemer reading a gay yoke like this movie like the fuck
some dude says there be Oscars for it ya the worlds worse movie"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Im a marvel fan but this put a smile in my face üòä
-_DJEzZk2pc,Meh
-_DJEzZk2pc,Disappointed. Heath Ledger is still has the best performance as the joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,When life shits on you a little too hard
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger as the Joker ü§ùJoaquin Phoenix as the Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gotta watch this üòÉ
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not Heath Ledger... sadly üò™
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gamers rise up
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This Phoenix doesn't work for me as a Joker at all, sorry. For me he is a tired, tragic clown and doesn't channel the scary, inpredictable lunacy, the ENERGY boiling under his skin all the time so he could jump into your face at any second and make the world burn.
Phoenix is an incredible actor, I just need this tension for the Joker I love.

Guess I will still watch it, because it still looks like a dark masterpiece made with a lot of love and dedication."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Uhhhh just looks like a cash-grab to me. I predict a dud.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Arf
-_DJEzZk2pc,This reminds me of a twisted metal black intro
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don‚Äôt get it .
-_DJEzZk2pc,OMG THE SOUNDTRACK GIVE ME CHILL
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The red nose is throwing me off 








Just me?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"In this film, more then in many others, the actor who plays the protagonist must be very good.
I think I would have seen this movie only if he (Joaquin Phoenix) had been there as the protagonist."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Very Good
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like a very bad movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Too much confusing
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm starting to get really tired of the constant reboots and remakes. It seems we have reached the limit of creativity in human beings.
-_DJEzZk2pc,How does this give Suicide Squad any continuity? I mean the actor‚Äôs great and all but the story and the cast... damn.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin more or less plays himself on screen with this that's why it is so fitting.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Hopefully D.C. Can get their crap straight and stop making different variations like, I don't know,...like Spider-Man. We need one style and then build on it."
-_DJEzZk2pc,His laugh is terrifyingly on point and I love it
-_DJEzZk2pc,And the Oscar goes to Joaquin Phoenix
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks ass
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Unless Joaquin also sends used condoms to his fellow cast members, there's no way he'll get the character right."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm retarded üíÄüò≠
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So, what relationship does this have to the DCEU? 

Is it like Venom with Marvel, (that it's not Actually a Part of the MCU), or is it like Spider-Man Homecoming, that they just rewrote the character for the 4,000,000th time to make it part of the DCEU?

And how does this relate to the Suicide Squad Joker?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope they will give this joker also the same scars that gave him te big smile like the Joker from the darkknight movie. It would be cool if this movie would be a prequel of the darkknight Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,welcome back DC
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hey motherfucker who runs this channel: Please eat shit and die.  Ripping a TEASER TRAILER that doesn't belong to you and CALLING THIS THE TRAILER is a scumbag move.  So go die.  Im filing a copyright strike as we speak.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Me sac√≥ de onda 1:47 porque lo le√≠ en espa√±ol.
-_DJEzZk2pc,A trailer is not a clue on how good a movie is.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Lokey is becomming the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,It sucks ass !!! Worst joker move ever
-_DJEzZk2pc,That's messed up dude
-_DJEzZk2pc,How can I get a trailer for a film when I‚Äôm watching a trailer from a film
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Man, shit looks good."
-_DJEzZk2pc,At 1:26 is a laugh that I can honestly say could 100 percent belong to the JOKER.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Man I hope this will be a good joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dark and gritty
-_DJEzZk2pc,"i was a bit skeptical when i saw the first pictures of  Joaquin Phoenix as the Joker but this looks pretty cool

The Joker is hands down one of the best comic villains of all time"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This says a lot about our society
-_DJEzZk2pc,You remind me of my father... I hated my FatherüòÇüò∏üòπ
-_DJEzZk2pc,thus guy over jared leto? i think not you guys
-_DJEzZk2pc,Best Joker since emperor Commodus!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Haha what a trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This mere glimpse into a person dealing with a mental illness and the battle that they go through with wanting to fit in or doing everything expecting of them to ultimately be shunned. In the end losing all the progress, until the spilt has fractured into so many different pieces of the same broken person that insanity and sanity begin to look like one in the same is haunting and mesmerizing. I can‚Äôt wait for this masterpiece and one of my favorite actors to take his rightful place in the forefront of acting royalty."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I don't get it, It just shows him getting beat up, where are his his witty plans? What's his ability?; being insane? Is this a build up to his change where he snaps? Just seems like a regular crazy dude, how is he even remotely an opponent to Batman?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wtf is ghis shit???Are you fucking serious
-_DJEzZk2pc,A cleverly filmed trailer but i aint fooled by that shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,An Oscar coming for this guy .....mark my words
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is it just me or does he look like Justine Trudeau the Canadian prime minister ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôm hype
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Has anyone else noticed that Joaquin Phoenix seems to be really good at playing grown men who are really close with their mothers? Like in ""You Were Never Really Here""."
-_DJEzZk2pc,No one is beating heath ledger for best joker ever no matter what
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Trailer doesn‚Äôt seem to give away much at all, just a sense of the theme. Looks dope!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So what your saying in this trailer is that Joker needs a safe space and a hug?

Virtue signaling for a character who is supposed to be a narcissist and psycopathic serial killer hmm.

Lets put this Joker on Dr. Phil and then Ellen, shit maybe the next election have him run as a Democrat; poor poor Joker is just a victim of bullying. 
‚úåüòÇ‚úå"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gonna be shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,100%  FREE OF FEMINAZIS OR TGBKHFQSCGB!   THANKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Why doesn't joker just get revenge on those bullies or something better, why doesn't he let karma decide what will happen to these horrible people they did to him? This is what I call justice."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'll always love dc but if I had one wish I would wish the suicide squad movie out of existence
-_DJEzZk2pc,Alfred and V from Atlanta on this????
-_DJEzZk2pc,"You best start believing in jokes, you‚Äôre in one!


Wait that cant be right"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Gotta say, the childish, multicoloured, progressive, power trip that is Marvel has no appeal to me. This however looks like a real, gritty movie.  May Oscar bless you Joaquin."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks really good. Joaquin Phoenix is a top notch actor.
-_DJEzZk2pc,It doesn‚Äôt seem to have that much to do with the comics. I don‚Äôt understand why DC movies borrow so little from the material they‚Äôre based on.
-_DJEzZk2pc,A thread full of edgelords and artfags on YouTube? No fucking way.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The true and most fit cleanser of Gotham's crooks.
-_DJEzZk2pc,im watching this just because people on twitter got so triggered by it
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wait tis isnt jared leto
-_DJEzZk2pc,This puts a smile on my face.
-_DJEzZk2pc,That change in tone of the song as he‚Äôs walking down the hallway and fully descended into the joker persona is beautiful and addicting to watch. Beyond excited to see this interpretation
-_DJEzZk2pc,Already love his joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ok this maybe a Joker done right.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joker?  How original!  Heath Ledger is dead, and the Joker died with him.  Why can't people understand that?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope he dies too.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Still trying to figure out how he gets those scars
-_DJEzZk2pc,Straight to Syfy.
-_DJEzZk2pc,One does not simply give the joker an identity
-_DJEzZk2pc,I bet that child must be bruce wayne üòÇü§£
-_DJEzZk2pc,Genuinely creepy. Bravo.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally! A real trailer of this movie!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"1989: throw him into chemicals
2019: tHrOw HiM iNtO sOcIeTy

Edit: How the hell did this garbage comment get this many likes, please I beg you to find good content"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Mr.phoenix welcome back to hollywood. He been an awesome actor this role will prove that.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yes!! He‚Äôs paying homage to all the greatest aspects of Heath Ledgers Joker from the length of his hair to the choice of clothes. Which gives me faith that he‚Äôs gonna nail it instead of trying to ride a wave like Leto did
-_DJEzZk2pc,They got domino in this movie. +Luck üòÇüòÇüòÇ
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Favorite part 
1:28-1:36 


I love the music in that part"
-_DJEzZk2pc,AWESOME
-_DJEzZk2pc,i actually have a good feeling about this
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel like Phoenix is going to be a good joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Saw it more than a few times . üî•üî•üî•üî•üëçüèº
-_DJEzZk2pc,gay
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel sad for him
-_DJEzZk2pc,"That still isn't Willem Dafoe, though. David Boreanaz Green Lantern as Hal Jordan and Willem Dafoe Joker in a lifetime in which it was so possible to do both and Dafoe even played the green goblin but the best possible casting choices turned into the worst sort of unwatchable claptrap with a failure of epic proportions... Joaquin Phoenix is a good enough actor, but also about as old as Dafoe now if that is a concern, so an origin story with someone of this age in the lead role as well as the introduction of a nuanced humanist angle that really defeats the whole point and purpose of who the Joker is in terms of the essence of that character. No. Just. No."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow!!! Id love to see this joker go up against ben afflect‚Äôs   batman
-_DJEzZk2pc,"lets all jump OFF the hype train and give this movie a real chance, ok? 
MOVIES ARE DIFFERENT THAN TRAILERS. And if you expect a movie to live up to a trailer, you're only going to disappoint yourself."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is it just me or do a lot of the over-enthusiastic comments here look like Hollywood-run bots?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Another example of turning a flat evil character into a sympathetic villain for no reason.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this connected to the dceu
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ugh. No. This isn't Joker. This is like Pennywise, Penny foolish trying to be all intellectual about it. The problem with this sort of sensationalist rubbish is on the one hand you have CGI and things or people blowing up with little else to show for it, but on the other you have this stuff that takes itself too seriously... They're both just jokes, in the end"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Its Confusing ...Its very cool and disturbing at the same time.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Men Dou's any one else think this movie locks bad
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm sorry I will disappoint you Joaquin, but Heath Ledger will always be the best actor who brought Joker's darkest feelings, dreams and generally dark, crazy side to the big screen with so much accuracy. Too bad he gave an end to his life... He would have received his Oscar...

Still you are very good and I will anticipate the premiere of the movie in my country."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Y'all on YouTube thinking you know what real society is to a man like that
-_DJEzZk2pc,lose the red nose and deal i dont see a joker and a clown as the same thing he just looks to much like a clown thats my only problem with it other wise better then jared leto joker already
-_DJEzZk2pc,When does he rip his face off and wear it? For joke only.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"*Everyone in the DCEU*

Boss man: alright guys and gals our movies haven't been great as of late.  We need a NEW and ORIGINAL idea. What should we do?

*Everyone sits in silence; thinking, crying, praying, one guy shot himself*

Random janitor: This writing team is a joke

Bossman: HOLYSHITGUYSIHAVETHEPERFECTIDEA"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This trailer is amazing, with the background music."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Worst. Joker. Cackle. Ever.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow a dc movie that is actually dark instead of fake emo?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin is 44 years old. Jared Leto is 47. Look at how much younger Jared looks than Joaquin. Even with facial hair. Why do you think that is?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I despise superhero movies but will watch this because JP.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I really dont think this is what people will want it to be.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don‚Äôt see any killings or bad Joker from batman. What kind of joker is he?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is dc actually making a good movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Movie is going to be shit. Joker isn't suppose to have an origin story. That's why he's such a good character. Also think the origin seems lame.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So confused by this. THey just released Suicide Squad that had Jared Leto as the Joker, and now we get an origin film with Juaquin Phoenix? and how is it that  he DOESN'T fall in the toxic crap that fucks him all up, and apparently Harley Quinn? I really hate this kind of shit, fifty different storylines going but yet its all for ONE character...."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Marvel -releases Avengers End Game trailer .
DC - Hold my beer."
-_DJEzZk2pc,YUNG BITCH AYT MY BUTOLE THEN I JUT GO BRO THANKYOU YUNG BITCH I AYT YA BUTOLE HOLLIE
-_DJEzZk2pc,"You have all these rules and you think they‚Äôll save you

I have one rule

Well that‚Äôs the rule you‚Äôll have to break to know the truth

Which is?

The only sensible way to live in this world is without rules and tonight you‚Äôre gonna break your one rule"
-_DJEzZk2pc,River would have played it better
-_DJEzZk2pc,"be sure to check out the master before watching this movie, but it's going to be hard to beat the dark knight joker performance. that's for sure."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Take is NOTHING close to the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:55 and 2:00 reminds me of Markiplier's Wilford Warfstache! XD
-_DJEzZk2pc,This just gets better every time I watch it. Can‚Äôt wait for October
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:08 this laugh is so creepy it's unreal
-_DJEzZk2pc,when Joaquin Phoenix whas named for this movie i wass so exited and now this trailer looks like pure gold and everithing is astonishing every detail looks amazing this is gonna win the oscar at least 3 oscars
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""If you give an insane man one task, and expect him to do it perfectly... Doesn't that make you the insane person?"" - Wraith of Paths"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I wouldn‚Äôt blame him for what he‚Äôs done ..this is a toxic society
-_DJEzZk2pc,This story is so tragic
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Between this and John Doe from that Batman game, damn. I'm going to have a lot of Joker feels, huh."
-_DJEzZk2pc,IS not just quips and CGI explosion with DC they want to tell a different kind of story
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks amazing!!!!!!!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Idk about this. One of the biggest standing points of the joker is that no one knows who he really is. It‚Äôs never been revealed to the audience. The only one who knows who he actually is, would be Batman when he is given his three questions from that machine thing in the comics, I don‚Äôt really remember what it was. This could be good but idk I‚Äôll have to wait to see it"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Over-hyped. It's going to bomb.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"What an amazing trailer! No one has given me the goose bumps as Joker since Heath. Joaquin is mighty close, I can't wait to see this story. üëÄüëÄüëÄ"
-_DJEzZk2pc,He‚Äôs gonna kick some ass .
-_DJEzZk2pc,the saddest part of life that people all of them are born evil
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I was worried this was going to be a shitty movie, but damn does it look good."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I must say, Joaquin is doing really good job acting Joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,now let see if this manage to rival the Heath ledger joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,If they have watch Gotham Then this movie would have actully great
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another... If I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,A good trailer but I doubt DC won't fuck it up like most of their other movies.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"No, no, no, an origin story for the joker, this breaks the character, this can't work!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,so Norman Bates is the Joker?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow
-_DJEzZk2pc,The Movie looks Awesome.And Joaquin Phoenix is great as Always.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"that swag at the end he has as the joker is reminiscent of nicholson's joker.  joaquin's joker might become the definitive joker if the movie is as good as this trailer.  amazing how we saw a man transform in one short clip.....from a sheepish, unstable fragile mama's boy into that badass clown at the end of the trailer...even the way he was walking down the hallway holding that bouquet of flowers oozed badass."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Makes you feel bad for the bad guy. That‚Äôs the point of this trailer. Wake the hell up.
-_DJEzZk2pc,That run he does is mesmerising.
-_DJEzZk2pc,There is just so much one can take
-_DJEzZk2pc,Daaaang. This looks amazing
-_DJEzZk2pc,WHY SO SERIOUS
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I wish they would stop with slow motion in blockbusters, if the moment truly is epic then it shouldn't need it. I also think the makeup is too much, the joker in mask of the phantasm had a good look. The white face wouldn't even have to be makeup, just a really pale man with slicked back hair. The entire clown back story is just silly."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can Goose Wayne have a cameo?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"piece of garbage movie.
way to change the entire back story of Jack Napier and the Joker, I officially ban this garbage movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,The walk is great to the downstairs..
-_DJEzZk2pc,this makes no sense
-_DJEzZk2pc,The joker that played in the dark night was the best joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow, freaky. Has some Taxi Driver elements to it. Which is one of the scariest movies of all time in my opinion."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"That studio really good at making trailers, let's see"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is going to be epic, better than all that CGI conveyor belt Avengers garbage...actors dream of playing Joker. A comedy satire on life tragedies... deep inside we all feel like Joker. Brilliant trailer, awesome acting and that haunting background score, nothing can beat Joker..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""I used to think my life was a tragedy, but now I realized it's a comedy""... Best line ever!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,OH THIS IS GONNA BE SO AWESOME!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Its shitty
-_DJEzZk2pc,Still not the same as the animated joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks bad for me
-_DJEzZk2pc,Your telling me this guy went crazy cuz he got beat up a couple of times. Lol that's not a valid reason anymore
-_DJEzZk2pc,I've said it before I'll say it again this film better not suck
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Hold up, this might actually be a good movie by DC."
-_DJEzZk2pc,nah.. how can someone that crazy & broke can be a problem that police cant handle & can goes toe to toe with multi billionaire dude with fancy gadget?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Thank god they didn't turn him into a transvestite drag queen.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This time they found a real mad man to play a mad man.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where is Batman?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""It's a Joke! It's all a Joke! Mother Forgive me..."" -The Comedian"
-_DJEzZk2pc,But will there be Batman? That's my question
-_DJEzZk2pc,is it just  me or this is so bland
-_DJEzZk2pc,I really really feel like this one is going to be an instant classic.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hype
-_DJEzZk2pc,Does this movie explain the orgin of the joker in the DCEU
-_DJEzZk2pc,Great trailer. I‚Äôm going to watch this!
-_DJEzZk2pc,My English teacher told me about this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Damn.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm not convinced Heath Ledger can ever be beaten as joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The rest of you must be seeing a different trailer than I am.  They shouldn't use the name Joker for the film to just make some social commentary.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Um... so, why the completely different and disconnected storyline and character being used for a classic character? This dilutes DC‚Äôs brands even further"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow, this actually looks... good!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Here comes the Joaqer!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Yeah, I don't know about this.  While I  don't doubt Phoenix's potential ability to BE the Joker, I'm not crazy about this ""its society's fault"" narrative that I'm seeing here."
-_DJEzZk2pc,ü§Æü§Æü§Æ
-_DJEzZk2pc,we live in a
-_DJEzZk2pc,sound track.... oh God
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hype for this movie : exactly the same as every other one... 0%
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dont ask who but I heared the people who are now making films are trying to use less money on CGI and explosions and just using a budget so if they flop they didnt loose anything
-_DJEzZk2pc,Get Ronald Mcdonald cameo.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Don‚Äôt look that good :/
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm going to be hearing that laugh at 1:09 in my dreams for a while, if I can sleep that is!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,that cinematography where he is running under the bridge/tunnel is so bad ass
-_DJEzZk2pc,Am I not merciful?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Best movie trailer ever
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gonna be better than Heath. Heath Ledger is probably the most overrated actor in history.
-_DJEzZk2pc,WoW!!üëçüëå
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Now this , this is a great joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,*this shit is retarded batman is an awfull shit marvel is better than DC*
-_DJEzZk2pc,U can‚Äôt have a joker with out Batman like u can‚Äôt have a thanos with out the avengers
-_DJEzZk2pc,The 150th Joker origin story. Honestly looks mediocre
-_DJEzZk2pc,"GAMERS RISE UP 


I USED TO THINK MY LIFE WAS A TRAGEDY"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Foriegners with their satanic occultic movies
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not sold on this film yet. I'm all for fleshing out the Joker's psyche but he is also the baddest ass psycho in Gotham City. I need to see violence. Otherwise he's just an emo dude in a green wig.
-_DJEzZk2pc,We're finally going to know the real joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"He can't hope to top Heath Ledger or Mark Hamill, but I'll take Joaquin Phoenix if it means we can all forget about Jared Leto's performance."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I sure hope they don‚Äôt wait till the end for him to completely lose it
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Instead of ‚Äúit‚Äôs a comedy‚Äù he should have said ‚Äúit‚Äôs hilarious‚Äù I dunno 



I don‚Äôt like rhyming lol


Good trailer tho"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Promete ser mejor esta versi√≥n, que la versi√≥n anterior del joker ü§°"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm trying. I'm really trying.

But no. I'm not interested. Not even slightly."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I like how DC is making villain movies suicide squad now joker later Gotham city siren's
-_DJEzZk2pc,So much better than Suicide Squad's Jokelo.
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:26 he nails the laugh hands down.
-_DJEzZk2pc,OMG... Could someone actually have gotten this right...??????
-_DJEzZk2pc,this thing looks like absolute dogshit. I don't even wanna call it damn film.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"now joker look like a loser uncle, pathetic"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don‚Äôt like this joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,dumbest Joker yet!! Why !! USE THE KID OFF GOTHAM!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin phoenix is onto something special here...this joker looks way different but familiar at the same time
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can't wait to see Joaquin Phoenix's take on Joker. Looks intriguing.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This trailer made me feel a little insane.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"God, this trailer is euphoric!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks absolute classic . Sound track was amazing. Really captured the emotions of joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,He seems like a good joker but do we need a backstory for this villain?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"More subversion shit... Oh, poor joker, just a victim of society, the true problem are white males and capitalism as we can already see in the trailer."
-_DJEzZk2pc,No one can ever do better than Heath Ledger.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why so serious??  :-)
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gonna be a classic just wait
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Dc now you got it right....
A dark theme movie belongs only to
To a dark character."
-_DJEzZk2pc,How true to life this trailer is.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I‚Äôm so fatigued by marvel studios.  I‚Äôm so glad to see a trailer where it‚Äôs not just CGI cash grabs and it looks to be deep and dark and sinister character building and great acting.  Not since Batman Begins, the dark knight, what all superhero movies needs to live up to.  At the core is humanity and how fucked up it can be."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Walks just like the joker we remember too.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"depiction of real joker is, psycho jester who always prank everyone. After it success he always laugh of loud. Remember one thing : joker alway LAUGH 

HA HA HA HA HA"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin Phoenix is versatile actor ...even his acting in movie ""HER"" is great.."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Let‚Äôs start placing bets: will Phoenix be a better joker than Ledger?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I dont trust this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,So insane
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix is gonna kill this shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,They shoulda used a Vatto from the barrio names Joker...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Literally gave me an ad of the trailer on the trailer video before the trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looked dope when he came out with the full joker outfit at the end& Joaquin Phoenix pulls it off. Now lets see how many idiots will be inspired by this to shoot up a crowd of people fucking sensitive sissies.
-_DJEzZk2pc,You do know he's not the joker right he's gonna die in the movie probably
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Let's face it, No one could ever Replace our Old Joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"oh good, they re-wrote the joker origion story and turned it into a Broadway musical while at the same time taking out all the moral dilemmas of his story, now hes just ""bad weird crazy guy"", cool."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Is it the Joker's fault he is the way he is... this world is a fucking bitch, lol you try and be the calm nice guy but then the world, well, the world does what it always does, just become a fuckin bitch. You can only stay sane so long, you can only take so much bs, when the world is a bitch to you too many times you gotta learn how to get back at it, whether humanity likes it or not..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,His costume looks weird
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks like it's really gonna suck
-_DJEzZk2pc,I use to think my life was a tradegy now I realize it's a comedy. Wise words from the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,despite
-_DJEzZk2pc,Movies are getting shitter
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please be good please be good please be good
-_DJEzZk2pc,That was a little intense there.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why do they keep changing the story why can't we just keep one story and that's it every movie that comes out it's a different origin why I don't understand I don't even want to watch Gotham no more it's not the same story
-_DJEzZk2pc,0:15 The Exorcist?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Never thought of Jaoquin as The Joker, but YES!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Another lame 'Wicked' attempt at understanding evil.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this like a Fractured Fairy Tale from Jokers perspective or am I just wrong over all?
-_DJEzZk2pc,https://share.viralpay.co/Krutel19
-_DJEzZk2pc,Shit movie. great choice lead actor though. Are you serious should have stopped with Ledger in dark night. That movie would have been the best end to this style of Batman movies. Just trying to repeat the same movie doesn‚Äôt work
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gamers rise
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gamers rise up
-_DJEzZk2pc,joker is badass again
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow, that was actually so good."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think Joker fall big poison.?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I like to think the joker was born from a male priest that got raped by the devil . Murdered and tortured hundreds of innocents by 16 . But whatevs water him down I guess.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I don't think they should've deviated from the comics it's such a great blue print to create one of the darkest villains that this just has me disappointed, I'm sure it'll be a good movie but maybe not for me"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Obviously the joker is the dude who shoots the Wayne's, feels bad and goes to cheer up young bruce with a forced smile"

-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this gonna be outside the dc universe is it gonna be an alternate universe
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So, some issues with it.
My biggest: the Joker literally has multiple origins, even if the Killing Joke is the most commonly accepted. The Joker simply doesn't tell the same one all the time. There is even an entire thing where he specifies he just picks the one that he likes most at that moment.
We weren't supposed to pity him either. We were supposed to find him as a fear inspiring monster of man. We aren't supposed to know why he does it, if any reason. just that he does when he feels like it."
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:10 now that sounds like a joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôm so excited
-_DJEzZk2pc,This makes me think of Joker is more of a good guy but still Crazy
-_DJEzZk2pc,This has a ton of potential. Hopefully this is finally the movie that gets people to take DC films seriously. God knows it's about time man...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Anyone else feel kind of sad for the joker now?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Masterpiece üçª
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The only movie to really emphasize this kind of behavior's origin was A Clockwork Orange. I have yet to see if a film will do that, but this one looks like it might be sort of close."
-_DJEzZk2pc,The Jokers been played so many times. But this Joker genuinely looks twisted. I'll give this a watch
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel the dark side of joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"80s.. Jack Nicholson
2000s.. Heath Ledger
2019.. Joaquin Phoenix? 
 üòíüòê"
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:51 - Is that a young Bruce Wayne?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Very excited to see it!
-_DJEzZk2pc,So how joker and batman will meet with this time frame? Since it was setup in early 90's or 80's if I not mistaken?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is that Van AND Paper Boi?!?!
-_DJEzZk2pc,The guy who played green goblin in spider man should be playing the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Heath ledger is the best joker yet, but who said no one can surpass him? It's okay to compare them with their predecessors, but it's Bad to diminish their efforts, every actors must strive to the best of their capabilities, to leave mark in history, to surpass their predecessors. Heath Ledger has set the milestone high, now let see if this man can surpass it."
-_DJEzZk2pc,People really comparing this to real life. Lmao Got your fair share of snowflakes  who would cry to their mom if their ice cream fell onto the sidewalk and they‚Äôre 30 and your fair share of wannabe alphas online that do so much for themselves and talk about victim mentality and how if you‚Äôre getting your ass beat by someone it was your fault for not fighting them off even if it‚Äôs not your fault that assholes actually do exist lmao this is great. Can‚Äôt even watch a movie or in this case a trailer and just enjoy it for what it is...  A movie based on a FICTIONAL CHARACTER. Jesus fuck...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Loves the trailer. Now I don‚Äôt need to watch the movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath ledger did the best job as joker. This movie looks terrible
-_DJEzZk2pc,The worst joker in the history
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This Joker is missing the sexy factor, gimme back Jared Leto please."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Isn't the joker supposed to be smart? This character doesn't strike me as a mastermind.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Poor guy man
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This trailer looks so damn good. But then again, so did Suicide Squad."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dumb. Heath Ledger will never be topped. This doesn't even come close.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Sorry, but that is not the Joker. I've been reading comics since 1979. The whole weird mother and son relationship was never in any of the Joker's origin stories. It's just weird. Hollywood directors and actors needs to stop trying to be creative. They change characters so much that they no longer resemble the source material in anything other than name. I'll pass on this one."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nope.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'll make note of this movie in my Ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,We truly do live in a society
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks special ...cant wait
-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôm actually really excited about this movie it looks good
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks garbage
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'd like to see the real joker play as joker, Mark Hamill!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Stupid
-_DJEzZk2pc,"at 0:26 Joker writes:
""the worst part about having a mental illness is
people expect you to behave as if you don't"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,This jokers really close to the comedian from watchmen
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So let me get this strait 
Society created one of the most iconic and dangerous villains of all time 
I LOVE IT üíôüòà"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Hmm, this could be an interesting movie, it's looks like it's got a bit of a Taxi Driver vibe to it. Plus Joaquin Phoenix is a solid actor, he's definitely got the charisma for the character. And as far as comic book characters go they don't really have to worry as much about character or story continuity with Joker, his character and origin are so mercurial over the years that any fresh, entertaining depiction of him gains kudos from Batman fans. Nicholson, Hamill and Ledger are all pretty beloved for their portrayals in part because they are all quite different from each other yet still really engaging to watch. 


So I've got some faith in Phoenix here. My only concern is that DC movies almost always have a good cast, it's the direction and writing where their movies sometimes fall flat. Either way though Phoenix in this trailer has got me interested."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please be rated R...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yawn
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix is gonna win an Oscar  for this! Mark my words!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This guy played very well in Gladiator movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Always good to go dark.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fucking stupid.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath ledger is possessing him üòÇüòÇ if we can't get the dark knight 2 with joker we'll settle for this 2:15-2:17 how I fuck the pussy üòÅ
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I can feel Oscar in the air  !!
Even though its just trailer !!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath ledger best joker in the world üò¢
-_DJEzZk2pc,2:08 Billy Elliot Last scene!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Reminder that Joaquin's brother River died at the age of 23 of a drug overdose. Reminder that they were both children raised in the Children of God cult which was known for encouraging the rape of children. Joaquin has been through more emotional torment than a great many people. That is why you see in his eyes an absolute truth in his portrayal of this role and most other's he's portrayed. We can only hope it offers him some catharsis as an emotional outlet.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"'I used to think my love was a tragedy, but now I realize, it's a comedy'"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can see this guy can portray a joker after heath ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin will for sure get an oscar nod
-_DJEzZk2pc,Will batman be in this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Just the first words he says about his mother, i have a feeling we are really going to sympathize for this joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Only need to see the trailer once and now I am ready for the movie!
-_DJEzZk2pc,trash.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I bet this is the joker origin, but this joker is the joker from the dark knight...his posturing his fall, everything... gonna be brilliant while giving respect and continuing into heath ledger's dc role..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hahahahaaaa NO!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Best thing about this, is just the bits and pieces of the film."
-_DJEzZk2pc,The jokers laugh at 1:08 is perfection
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is only a teaser trailer, not official."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie is going to be complete shit.
-_DJEzZk2pc,So was that news reporter on the TV talking about Batman?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm hyped
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""The worst part of having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you dont""

i really do hope this movie don't suck as much as SS.... it seems to have lot of potential"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So what, society made me do it..? Give me a break this sucks"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow, that looks sad and disturbing. Looks interesting."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Anyone else who tries to play the Joker will always be in the shadow of the one and only true Joker, Heath Ledger. An Joker is nothing without Batman. Not going to waste my money on this"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Holy crap. Not what I expected
-_DJEzZk2pc,How many times do they need to reboot the Joker?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Yeah, because everyone is a bully. I just don‚Äôt see people in suits beating up someone randomly"
-_DJEzZk2pc,3.6k people (and counting) probably think George Clooney is the best Batman ffs
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why not Jeremiah?
-_DJEzZk2pc,OH MY GOD ITS SO GOOD
-_DJEzZk2pc,Pretty Good! I haven't watched a movie at the theaters in a long time. This trailer made me want to go and see it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,THAT ENDING SMIRK!! üî•üî•
-_DJEzZk2pc,When is all this comic stuff gonna end. Let Cinema breath for a few (10) years
-_DJEzZk2pc,"this makeup for this joker is totally awfull, what a shame for the creator of this sequel of joker, in compare with others jokers this is shht..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,One of the greatest reality in this Practical world.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wdf is it being a joker and evil/crazy !! Cant we just have a joker who actually is normal and got a happy life...üôé
-_DJEzZk2pc,i wanna cry for this guy
-_DJEzZk2pc,They should of left it with Heath ledger's performance I doubt it's going to be out done.
-_DJEzZk2pc,My favourite part 2:16
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie is racist now.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"As intrigued as I may be, Heath Ledger will always be my Joker....RIP."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Please DC don't fail this like you did with Suicide Sqaud etc. The Joker is one of the most iconic movie villains in history... ""both fingers crossed""
P.s. the trailer is f*cking awesome"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The Hell w/ _Adrien Brody,_ Detective Comics 826, & anything _Killing Joke_ related *WE'RE HOLLYWOOD & WE KNOW ICONS BETTER THAN YOU DO !!!*

That's what this Trailer is saying.."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Based off this trailer the movie feals like it will not good.
Hopfully that is not the case."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"One thing that would top off this Movie for me is if Joker does his Injustice: Gods Among Us Fatality on one of the forces of darkness in this movie.

Nonetheless, I put my full faith in Joaquin Phoenix as Joker. Looking forward to it."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now we gotta wait untill the Bat joins in. Better have a great twist on it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now if heath was still alive today
-_DJEzZk2pc,my goodness
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Psycho Tearsüò¢
Phoenix‚ù§"
-_DJEzZk2pc,What the Hell was that???
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is riding off the dark night joker style
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'd love it if the whole movie was based on him talking to the therapist. 
Telling about how he got to where his is now in life. 
But it's a bunch of different stories. And by the end of the movie he's sitting in the chair... in full on ""Joker"". And the therapist is dead in the other chair. 
The whole time he's been talking to himself, telling multiple versions of his origin. 
We're still left not knowing how he ever came to be. 
Just a terrifying journey through his psychotic schizophrenia."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""What kind of coward...someone who hides behind a mask""...his son...Batman."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can relate
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker forever.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Really love that there wasn't a trailer for the trailer at the beginning. Hate that shit.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Finally, a good actor to play the joker


Now excuse me while I bleach my eyes because of Leto"
-_DJEzZk2pc,When are they going to give up on the Joker!?? They are never going to be able to make a Joker movie with the performance heath ledger put up.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"My love, Joaquin..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,They killed Heath.  Do not give a damn.... They killed Heath.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""We live in a society"" 
-The Jester"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"i could relate to this clown prince of crime.. hes been hurt a lot... he sees the bright side EVEN IF ITS AN UGLY WORLD. he wants everyone to smile anyway

everyone laughs at arthur flec puts him down constantly walks all over him and he sees his life as a comedy cause everyone is making fun of him laughing at him... until he is done letting society hurt him... hes gonna make himself mean something.. making EVERYONE LAUGH AND BRING THEM JOY.... IN THE SAME WAY THE WORLD DID TO HIM."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hopefully this will erase Leto's version from my mind. Kind of stoked about this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I cannot emphasize anymore mr. J Phoenix or your role of this this is epic and love and forgiveness for the loss of your brother.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Holy shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where's batman?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Some movies today are real in so many ways! 
Two actors from the show Atlanta are in this. That's dope."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Meh
-_DJEzZk2pc,I miss heath Ledger...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this finally going to be a good movie by DC???.... ü§îü§îü§®ü§®
-_DJEzZk2pc,Mister Phoenix if you read this or if anyone reads this! I am seriously in tears! From the very beginning I have always said Mr J Phoenix you are the character to play the essence of the Joker! Not to take anything for mr. Ledger but Mister Phoenix again I am in tears finally you have the role that you were born for thank you!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Unbelievable! This movie looks like 100%
-_DJEzZk2pc,OMG he's lost so much weight for this role bleh bleh bleh
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks awful....
-_DJEzZk2pc,It takes either balls or some insanity to try being the Joker after Heath Ledger killed it perfect the last time. I'd have taken a pass on that roll.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"God bless all jokers,  but,  joker is becoming Joker!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Damn! This is gonna be epic.
-_DJEzZk2pc,God dammit.  That whiteboy is gonna make joker a damn protagonist. He's a damn brilliant.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Goin' to be different from Heath's Joker, but I am looking forward to seein' this. Joaquin is a phenomenal actor. If y'all have not seen The Master, check it out...."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This joker is a joke ..lmao ..this movie is gonna be trash
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hopefully he doesn‚Äôt die
-_DJEzZk2pc,At this point im starting to think all the new jokers not trash but  ledger was just to good
-_DJEzZk2pc,Loki deserves a film of his own as well.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This version of the joker seems like he's the closest to what the person who created the joker wanted his character to be
-_DJEzZk2pc,Imagine if heath and Joaquin teamed up as jokers.. soüî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•like yo that shit would be lit
-_DJEzZk2pc,Academy award for the best actor in the leading role
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The best joker.  And  a black man who followed Phoenix.  I can't wait to see this. Only actor who could do better? Simon
..and that's me!!!haha.. That's me!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Smile, because it confuses people. Smile, because it's easier than explaining what is killing you inside.

The Joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Creepy as sh*t
-_DJEzZk2pc,Does joker do anything bad in this one or does he just get bullied
-_DJEzZk2pc,Half of all villains once wanted to be heroes. This new Joker looks good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think DC is going in the right direction with this movie. I like the fact that they're going with the retro theme. Building up to the batman origin story. I'm excited
-_DJEzZk2pc,Am I the only one who thinks it looks more like a horror movie than an action movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Man this will be the best movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Am I the only one who got bored during the trailer? Like seriously, this doesn't look like a Joker film it looks like a stupid drama."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Really like that last shot.  He's got the make up that looks like he's smiling, but the eyes are totally cast in shadow.  If I'd ever seen the joker depicted that way before I'd call it iconic."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can it be October already
-_DJEzZk2pc,No thanks DC. I'll stick with Marvel. üíØüíØ
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh man this is gonna be good
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie is going to suck...
-_DJEzZk2pc,BOZOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      DC we need to talk ...
-_DJEzZk2pc,White man bad. Garbage.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm 50/50 on this one. It will take one hell of a performance to make me sway to this version of the Joker. BUT, i am willing to give it a chance, Joaquin Phoenix is a good actor and if he can put more savagery in this character, then I will be hooked..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,He's good but he's no Heath Ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,What?
-_DJEzZk2pc,yah should make a  granny trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don't get the story? Is he a different type of joker? Not related to the Batman world?
-_DJEzZk2pc,that guy that joker made smile was confirmed to be bruce wayne (gasp) at 1:53
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Heath Ledger and Mark Hamil are my 2 favorite Jokers, and I think I just found my 3rd."
-_DJEzZk2pc,this looks like it's going to be amazing! <3
-_DJEzZk2pc,He's gonna knock a home run as the Joker üòé
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is it rated R? If it is DC isn‚Äôt risking it I can see here..
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Finally, with Joaquin fucking Pheonix at the helm, the DCEU can finally get a good movie.,"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"something new


and something old"
-_DJEzZk2pc,We are all Jokers
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hmmm.... Guess ill give this movie a shot.
-_DJEzZk2pc,you could have had me instead of that dumb jock chad. now you'll pay.
-_DJEzZk2pc,the running scene is so touching
-_DJEzZk2pc,The worst part of having mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don't
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh look another shitty joker movie!
-_DJEzZk2pc,It definitely made me unsettled. It has a 70's film vibe and this unexplained umcomfortable feeling attached to it
-_DJEzZk2pc,How tf do I get a youtube notification from a channel I'm not subbed to
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow, this says a lot about our society"

-_DJEzZk2pc,"My life isn't a tragedy




It's a comedy"
-_DJEzZk2pc,ooh
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think hell be a better joker.  Phoenix  actually seems deranged as a real life person
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I dunno. I don‚Äôt dislike the idea of you being he joker.. I just wish the franchise had some solidarity. Any, really."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel so bad for him.... and idk if that makes me insane or open minded...
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope this one gets him some big trophies
-_DJEzZk2pc,All I asked for was one extra animal balloon.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I think some people are over thinking this movie in terms of a comic book universe.  I don't think that's the point of the film.  This is likely to be a one off.  I think it's a movie that will resonate with people that deal with depression, or inner demons and a society that largely doesn't see it or understand it.  Of course this story leads to the development of a villain.  But a whole lot of people deal with depression by projecting happiness on to others, and then go home to be alone with it."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Damn, we live in a society"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I need to see this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath ledger joker wil always be the best. I'm happy Joaquin is doing his own thing. I disliked this trailer though.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""My mother always told me to smile and put on a happy face"" 
Oh god please don't do this to me"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Loved the trailer, not sure about the laugh though."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I still don't get how a movie can be made about a villain, still excited about the movie tho"
-_DJEzZk2pc,My childhood is worse and I still grow up a good man
-_DJEzZk2pc,No CGI? Fuck me.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This one trailer has more depth, substance and emotion than anything Hollywood has created in the last 80 years."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like the actor is great in the trailer! Now to see if he is in the actual movie... Can he do a better job than Heath Ledger? (Dark knight Joker)
-_DJEzZk2pc,this looks dumb as hell
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This trailer alone is amazing, can't wait for the actual movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Are there really no other villains in the DC universe? And for the record I know the answer, it just seems Hollywood does not."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is so sad




 Can I get an F in the chat?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,this looks boring and disappointing
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I grew up always thinking the villain in a movie just hated the good guy, but i never realized the villain is trying to be the good guy the whole time"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix will get caught up in this role and really mess him up. He‚Äôs one of the best actors all time.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The smile at the end was super creepy.






That is why this actor is one of the best joker actors"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"that is what should be joker
Clothes 
Walking or running 
Dancing 
Talking and thinking
Smile 
The body 
Fighting 

I repeated this video like 40  times .

He is the original Joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,RIP heath ledgar
-_DJEzZk2pc,"1:38 they throw him out of the Wayne hall !!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gotham's society is so chaotic and mean spirited that it basically created something that is arguably as terrifying as facing Darkseid face to face.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Mind blown! Looks awesome!
-_DJEzZk2pc,normally i dont like dc but i think this movie will actually be good
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I rather like the Joker who is insane to begin with. You don't know what drives him on. Is it money? Is it destruction? Someone without morals, looking down below everyone. Not fearless, but not predictable. Doing things just because. And if people die, who cares? About that is the Joker. A danger, uncontrolable but not stupid."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Now all that is missing is some loon goes off because of this movie and kills people at theaters.......... oh wait, that was done before.  No copycats please."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sorry there are only two people who played the joker well. This actor is not one of them
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:43 that body holy shit that looks like something from a horror movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this fanmade
-_DJEzZk2pc,does anybody knows the song

-_DJEzZk2pc,And the Oscar goes to...........
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ok, lot of ignorance in the comments, so I'll correct a bit of it.
1. The Joker has had many origin stories told, a large number by the character himself.
2. The Killing Joke was NOT the first one, is NOT a comic book, IS a one off graphic novel, and originally NOT intended to be cannon. Most DC fans can't ignore it's suspicious release year of 1988 being do close to the release of Batman, starring Jack Nicholson as the Joker with a very similar origin. 
3. The Joker's first origin story came in 1951 in Batman Vol. 1. 11 years after his debut in Batman #1, published in 1940. (He was the man behind the Red Hood).
4. What makes Joker so iconic is his insane unrelatable personality. He's the villain we don't quite understand, and can't really sympathize with. We also don't know where the fuck he came from (he already existed under the Red Hood). The character himself can't even get his own origin story straight.

Basically, this might be a good movie, but you twits saying it's more like the comics than any other joker are full of shit. This Joker, judging from the trailer, is the least like the comics.... Ever."
-_DJEzZk2pc,always worries me when the trailer is Amazing! hopefully these aren‚Äôt the best bits. looking forward to viewing this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"QQ """
-_DJEzZk2pc,"How will Batman ever defeat this whimpering, whining, sissy? Oh wait..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Awsome trailor...Not much violence...Save it for the movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this real or fan made
-_DJEzZk2pc,"wonder how much weight he had to lose to prepare for this role that shown his skeletons. i wonder if the reason he finally snapped was his mom died of disease or someone killed her. in the trailer it shows that he is very close w her, almost like she's his sole reason for living"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Was that Joaquin Phoenix?!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I don't this is evil enough, sorry."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks alot like the killing joke jokers origin.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The perfect actor for the Joker.!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yoooo I have to see this.  I can't wait.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow, so disappointing. Why does the Joker have to be white, HUH? So fucking racist. To bad Jordan Peele isn't making this movie. Then we would see a black Joker. Nah, just kidding. I was expecting a black joker though or a woman. I really wanted to trash it for those reasons, oh well I guess the whites win this one. Trailer was fucking brilliant though, can't wait till October."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Actor + OST

-_DJEzZk2pc,No one beats Heath ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Thanks DC... The world's mentaly ill are already causing grievous harm... but I trust that this movie has a way of turning things away from that... and it better, because that great song 'Smile' is meant to be encouraging in a positive peace-loving way =/"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Jack Nicholson joker - calm, genius, cruel 
-
Heath Ledger joker - psychopath, funny, witty 
-
Joaquin Phoenix joker - has the potential to be epic."
-_DJEzZk2pc,finally... a movie worth waiting for again. after all this B.S. flooding cinemas the last years.
-_DJEzZk2pc,People in movies should realize that if you beat up someone and they're laughing should probably book it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,gamers rise up
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Feels like if you took one part Taxi Driver, one part Falling Down, and three parts The Killing Joke, then put them in the oven at 400¬∞ F, sprinkled a little method acting on top, and served it with a side of psychological thriller.

-_DJEzZk2pc,you know its gonna be good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Todd Phillips is the director in this movie (the guy that made the hangover movies )  so I am not expecting any masterpiece from him.
Just something above average will do.

The legend. The crazy. 
Gives you chills. 

Joaquin Pheonix:
The successor. The insane.
Gives you goosebumps.

All honesty though. This may be it. This man, may be the perfect, the best fit for joker ever. He seems so accurate to the comics too. His laugh is really fitting, it sounds amazing. He is an amazing actor and truly gave me chills. Like the joker is supposed to. I have high expectations for this man."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie looks so shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I must be in the minority, because I think this looks horrible, I am not excited to see this in the least.  I have been anticipating this for years and I am not impressed."
-_DJEzZk2pc,It looks ok
-_DJEzZk2pc,Madness people made a joker... He is a victim.

-_DJEzZk2pc,"It doesn't appear that Batman is present in this version of joker. That being said, one of the cornerstones of a Heath Ledger type joker is his obsession with batman.

-_DJEzZk2pc,looks fantastic....cant wait
-_DJEzZk2pc,How fucked up would it be if he died during the filming of this like Heath Ledger. It‚Äôs like a curse of the Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Did anyone else see Bruce Wayne in the trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,and where is Harley Quinn?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix will make this movie. Great actor. I don't think I would want to watch the origin story otherwise.

-_DJEzZk2pc,Did anyone else notice at 1:45 that the cop chasing him is the same cop that Heath Ledger‚Äôs Joker is taunting in ‚ÄúThe Dark Knight‚Äù before he blows up the police station?

This joker > got thrown into toxic society 

Refreshing"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I am so ready for this
-_DJEzZk2pc,A lot of people seem to miss the subtle tribute to Heath Ledger! The dance on the stairs seems to be a nod to Heath doing the same in 10 Things I Hate About You...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I can't fault what I've seen of the acting here at all. But...wasn't Joker born from a vat of chemicals after Batman failed to save him and that was why he dedicated himself to fighting Batman? To show him that he can't and isn't always going to be the ""hero""? I'm a little torn. The actual actor seems to portray Joker ridiculously well but...the story seems a little off. I'm just a bit fed up with them constantly changing the origin stories of iconic characters in order to be more PC or edgy or sell more tickets or whatever it is they're trying to do. Just tell the story the way it was written. Except Green Lantern. John Stewart was the best Green Lantern and they gave us Hal bloody Jordan."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks so good! Now of DC can get their shit together for their DCU that would be great.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I genuinly believe the creepiest representation of the Joker in years is that red nose scene at 1:49. Maybe not in the whole movie but surely in this trailer.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Finally no stupid explosions, no stupid suspenseful deaths and end of the world stories like Avengers or those types of shitty movies, damn after 2 years I may finally go back to the cinema"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow
-_DJEzZk2pc,Uhm? Yea! This looks great.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks dope! Is it part of the DCU?
-_DJEzZk2pc,All I think about is Heath Ledger when watching this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath who??????
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this real?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oscar coming his way
-_DJEzZk2pc,In my opinion this is trailer is completely cringy. He looks now where near villainous. The joker is supposed to be scary not cringy and anti climatic. Cameron monohan is better than nearly all other jokers but that‚Äôs my opinion.
-_DJEzZk2pc,That scene in the elevator looks AMAZING. I wholeheartedly believe that scene will be stunning.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Once again, Hollywood glorifying violence for profit. Thanks, no."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Definitely going to watch. Joker is my favorite hero? of all times.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This dude got 3 million views for stealing a trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why does no one reply if I said Liam Hemsworth is the right one to play Batman.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I like that the trailer doesnt say or show a whole lot but yet reveals SO much as to how epic this movie is gonna be...I have a feeling this is gonna be arguably one of the best if not the best renditions to the best most complicated Villians of all time...the Joker...all im waiting is for it to be R rated ü§ûü§û
-_DJEzZk2pc,If this movie is good. They should reboot from this point. Remove everything of Batman and Bruce Wayne from Wonder Woman and any references to the Justice League from Aquaman and begin to build the DCU more properly with a new batman. Maybe Shazam fits in there somehow too if its good.  Give us one character at a time and build it up.  You can give us a new Superman too.

-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôm so freaking happy they chose Zazie Beetz to be Arthur‚Äôs love interest. How did it take this long to have a black woman be a normal character in a DC movie????!!!!

-_DJEzZk2pc,"This looks really good, I'm afraid I'll feel bad for the joker. I felt bad for him in the trailer."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix is a great actor but what say film to us? It doesn't look like a Batman or Joker film.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Was that Bruce Wayne behind the gate as a boy?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Does anyone else think that's little Bruce Wayne @ 2:41?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"They have one amazing actor here. The script, dare I say, appears to live up to his brilliance.  I sure hope this is true."

-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin is going to fuckin nail that thing. Hope he doesnt get mad after it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This maybe not the joker most people want but this is the joker that we need.

...I was wrong."

-_DJEzZk2pc,What time is it
-_DJEzZk2pc,Good choice for the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Despite only being 13% of the population
-_DJEzZk2pc,thank god. a dc movie actually worth seeing
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I just read tons of comments below praising this movie, what I don't see is a single comment from the 3 thousand dislikes. Marvelovers are really really shaking."

-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh my god I‚Äôm shaking

-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm a little puzzled by the decision to give him the classic suit from the comics, but alter the face... still, looks like a worthwhile movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh poor joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Make up needs a tweak 
But the performance... woah boy!
For me it‚Äôs good, there‚Äôs that subtle hint of sadness that turns into insanity.

-_DJEzZk2pc,This trailer has only been out a few days but I‚Äôve already watched it twice as many times as the end game trailer. I can‚Äôt wait!

-_DJEzZk2pc,"The Joker is wrong. His life is a tragedy. Even when he turns into what he is, it's sad to think a once normal, struggling man turned into a monster. A monster that the world made. Gotham is an evil place."
-_DJEzZk2pc,https://share.viralpay.co/Smokez4Dayz
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Finally a good joker to take the mantle, the Jared leto joker was possibly the cringiest and worst villian I've ever seen. Ledger would be proud to see this."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The Part where he's crying and trying to smile, that is so fucking deep, I don't know why that makes me feel so bad for him"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Would be nice if this is a real story-telling and not some pathetic DC comic. Hard to believe that Hollywood is still producing stories worth telling and not some iteration of a generic theme.
-_DJEzZk2pc,There is a new Batman coming? Who's Joker is this?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"GaMERS,,, RISE UP!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Leto buried The Joker, Phoenix brought him right back."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Batman is boring old spoiled guy. Long live JOKER !!! #TEAMJOKER
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why so serious?
-_DJEzZk2pc,The movie Heath Ledger never got to star in. This looks really good. I think the darker versions of these comic book characters are so much more interesting. The last three Batman movies by the Nolans were incredible and very realistic. Not alot of computer animated crap.
-_DJEzZk2pc,WOW!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is going to be some tragic shit, but in a good way."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Been waiting for this...i love Joaquin Phoenix...amazing trailer...almost looks same as heath ledger joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gotta say that was kinda boring
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel sorry for the actor . This will be a wery bad movie .
-_DJEzZk2pc,That is twisted
-_DJEzZk2pc,jared leto is a fucking joke comparing to this...
-_DJEzZk2pc,He looks like David mazouz.
-_DJEzZk2pc,boring and pointless
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gay üôÑ
-_DJEzZk2pc,This gave me the feels
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger would have approved:)
-_DJEzZk2pc,I guess Keith ledger will always be the greatest joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,im sure the lil kid at 1:50 is bruce wayne
-_DJEzZk2pc,Eeeeeeeeeeeeeh
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope this movie has action and is not to damn slow
-_DJEzZk2pc,Doesn't look too bad. But I'm still not sure if it's good or necessary to give him a backstory. Might ruin the character. Sometimes a villain should just be that. The villain. Sometimes there's just no need for explaining an origin.

-_DJEzZk2pc,"I honestly love every Joker in different ways. I don‚Äôt discriminate and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll love this portrayal as much as I loved all of the others. I like Nicholson best, but after him there was Ledger; a dark, cynical character intent on world destruction. And Leto! An obsession driven man run by his emotions, driven by desire. And now Phoenix,  just an average everyday guy driven mad. By what? Society? Is this movie some sort of commentary? Or is it more of a lifting of the curtain on the madness inside us all? What about a sad story of mental illness left untreated? Not sure yet, but am I fucking excited! :3"

-_DJEzZk2pc,I wonder if Batman would make a short appearance

-_DJEzZk2pc,Phoenix is incredible.  I‚Äôve always loved this guy.  Even with some of the fantastic stuff he‚Äôs done he‚Äôs still underrated in my opinion.

-_DJEzZk2pc,hmmmm I smell oscar with this one
-_DJEzZk2pc,Total piece of crap. Joker is some pussy who was treated like piece of shit and got mad. So typical.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This, endgame and godzilla kom can't wait"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"No offense to some of the people who believe they are making magic here in this movie but personally for me, I don't think watching someone on screen, who is by himself with no support from other family members,  taking care of his disabled mother in the lower end of society, is good cinematography. In my opinion, this is not theatrical cinematography to enjoy with your girlfriend. This might be only my opinion, but I look at Jared Leto's 'Joker' in the 'Suicide Squad' movie and I see something more interesting - his portrayal reminded me of a joker that has already made it to the top of the criminal underworld and that's why he had a wardrobe that look bright and expensive and enticing. He wore it, not because he wanted to show off, but simply because money was overflowing from his restructuring of the criminal world. It's a shame that all the scenes Jared Leto was proud of making were cut from the film because it would've subtracted the attention of the audience away from the main characters and Will Smith. Jared Leto's joker had elements of the 'Italian Mafia Enforcer' type style and 'the Yakuza loose-canon Captain' style. You can see that comparison from the 2 or 3 scenes of the joker that were still left in the movie. I just wish youtube didn't immediately attack Jared Leto for something we hadn't seen on screen. It was all cut. Anyway, my point is, I rather see flashy stuff that you cannot see in real life rather than Joaquin Phoenix' portrayal of a single white male alone with responsibility on his shoulders and zero support, which is everywhere in real life. There is no movie needed to see it. Just my thoughts."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Being told to smile about everything bad happening in your life is not the best answer - because grinning while your house is burning really does make you look insane.

If you're sad, cry. If you're angry, find a punching bag or scream into a pillow. Find someone to talk to, pray to the Lord Jesus.


Just my 2 cents that no body asked for, but still...Joker is still a villain and I have to wonder if this origin story is true compared to all the other stories I heard."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don't know if this trailer cured my depression or made it worse ü§î... I'll just go with both
-_DJEzZk2pc,0:57 he gives me the vibe of Robert De Niro in Cape Fear. Omg I cant wait to see this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Im shook. This is the first time the Joker is scary, like really really scary and yet you feel bad for him. Wtf."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Tbh i feel like this could be a good backstory for heath's joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Either it is the best movie ever made based on comics or the worst
-_DJEzZk2pc,Best movie in the world
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Heath ledger entered the chat

-_DJEzZk2pc,That‚Äôs cooooool
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This movie makes joker look like a wuss. Joker is supposed to be a deranged psychopath not a fff‚Äôn circus clown who gets his feeling hurt, wtf c‚Äômon !!. I thought Joaquin Phoenix retired, he should have stayed that way. There is nothing disturbing on that circus clown at all... Just saying."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is the best Joker since Jared Leto.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Society is the monster and these guys are the claws.

The performance of Joaquin Phoenix is phenomenal! He has a gift from God!
This is not acting, but real Art..!!!"

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Too weird.
This isn't the Joker.
Heath Ledger was the Joker."

-_DJEzZk2pc,Dude! That looks really good!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is all wrong. The Joker is not a victim. The Joker is an embodiment of chaos. The Joker wasn't driven mad, he is as sane as one could be. What makes The Joker seem insane is that he is the most apathetic human that ever existed."
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:08 thank me now
-_DJEzZk2pc,I am so excited with this film. Phoenix is one of my favourite actors so far.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôm so glad that people aren‚Äôt hating on this like my friends at school. I never liked watching dc films unless the joker was in it bc I felt like the joker was the only reason the dc universe was any good. This movie kinda proves my point in my opinion.
-_DJEzZk2pc,and heath ledger ist the one and only real Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why are DC movies sucking lately? Batman is fat and the joker is not the joker. Marvel is way better.
-_DJEzZk2pc,they brought my boi Shakespeare into the mix

-_DJEzZk2pc,Phoenix is evoking sympathy and scare at the same time.... The aspect of sympathy was not touched by Heath Ledger's joker....

-_DJEzZk2pc,"0:47 
yooo what happened to his left arm"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"To see the world in all it's ugliness and pain to be beaten down by it humiliated constantly. All the while you just want people to smile and be happy, you keep telling them to be happy but no matter how many times i smash his face into the concrete he just will not be happy and smile. Oh well maybe they just don't understand that them not being happy is like someone carving into my brain as the rats squeak. I know its his wife's screaming from the other room maybe that's the problem if i cut her throat and tie her arms and lags with wires then i can make her dance for him. No he is still not happy i can never make the mirror man happy he has cracks in his face."
-_DJEzZk2pc,this looks horrible

-_DJEzZk2pc,WHY THESES MOVIES ALL OVER THE PLACE? BY TIME THIS JOKER WOULD HAVE MET BATMAN HE WOULD BE 80!!! HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN YOUNGER. I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A GOOD MOVIE. IS THIS JOKER FOR THE TV SHOW OR THE MOVIE'S??? YOU NO WHO WOULD BE A GOOD JOKER THE GUY THAT PLAYED THE BEAST IN GLASS???? HE PLAYED THAT PART

-_DJEzZk2pc,It's it just me or is it getting crazier out thereüé≠
-_DJEzZk2pc,The problem with this is that the joker is a walking mystery. If you tell his past it makes the character less interesting. But either way I‚Äôm siked to this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not into it
-_DJEzZk2pc,There is only one Joker -> Heath Ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,Cannot wait! Finally something good from DC!

-_DJEzZk2pc,This is gonna burn the Oscars
-_DJEzZk2pc,I really miss the joker as funny character. This psycho/drama in superhero films are getting so lame. When can superhero movies be unrealistic and kitschy again?

-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie NEEDS to be rated R

-_DJEzZk2pc,OMG sooo Good ! excited to watch this
-_DJEzZk2pc,The joker should have been Jared Leto
-_DJEzZk2pc,That's how world produces evils and beasts.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"They should of put Jared Leto as the joker i loved him as the joker if they wanted him to look old then they could of just made him look old but I don't like that, sense the movie seems like its the beginning of joker he should look young and be younger and he looks like he's in his 40's  what the heck I don't get it!"

Also I felt like I was seeing Heath Ledger's Joker in the making but it felt more like understanding why he became how he did. The suit was a little much but it was a clean, sharp look. At least it's not Jared Leto, he needs to just stick to 30 Seconds to Mars....which no one has heard from."

-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is why Batman is my favorite comic/cartoon since childhood. His rogues gallery has some of the most memorable and iconic ones of all time.  There are some that even outdo that Dark knight himself, and that's saying something.  There's not only the Joker but Two-face,  Penguin, Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, The Riddler, Ra's al Ghul and the League of Assassins,  Scarecrow, Bane, Catwoman, Harley Quinn, and Clayface just off the top of my head. Each one of them can spawn their own movies. It's nuts that the whole Batman universe is so vibrant and entertaining. 


Not only that, but as an avid gamer, Batman's Arkham series is arguably the best superhero video game I've ever had the pleasure of playing. I really hope this movie succeeds, particularly because Joaquin Phoenix is seemingly giving his own take of the Joker instead of trying to outdo previous actors who took on the role. I can't wait!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin phoenix is the right guy for this ! - Who ever signed him up is a genious - I cannot wait to see this !
  Bats has got to appear somewhere in this ? - unless the licence does not allow him to meet Bats and there for we learn everything we have to know the Joker AKA the man with so many names we really don't know what to call him ? - And as with *Smallville just as they meet the credits roll ? Hahaha!  
     Going on a tangent there sorry ! -But does anyone know whos playing Bats/Bruce ? -In this amazing movie thats just been pulled from the bottom of the pack ?

* Yes Smallville remember Smallville - On their Superman licence it said In very large l letters :- 
No Flights - No Tights ! - 
And at the very end Tom Welling ripped open his shirt revealing the most famous 'S' in the World /Universe /Multiverse ? - Wow we all gasped ! - Supes is here ! - Superman ..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This really doesn‚Äôt seem promising to me at all. Looks like is set up for 60 mins minimum of slow paced off character backstory.

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Every Joker ever put on film is the same, yet so different. Each actor brings his own take of the character. I love that! This movie will stand on it's own just like all of the Joker movies did in the past. Well, also, because it's different.  We've never had a character study of Joker before showing so much of his human side. Imagine if they did another movie with Harleen Quinzell in this character study style and then put the two together for a third film of the Joaquin's Joker and Harley Quinn together.  OMG! Idk who would play her though. Joaquin Phoenix is PERFECT."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don't actually see the purpose of this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I am sure Joaquin is going to do a great performance , but I don't now if the mivie will work whit out batman. But definetelly this is the joker justice dc needs"

-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm reporting this, please all do this. They are stealing other's hard work."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Interesting.  I liked Jack Nicholson's Joker, however his character wasnt crazy nor did he turn into a joker until after he was tossed into that chemical vat."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Lucas was right üòÇ
-_DJEzZk2pc,Does anyone else think this looks kinda boring?
-_DJEzZk2pc,YES! Everybody put your happy face for the upcoming joker movie!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This seems like its gonna be a very interesting take on the Joker. A man having been wronged by the world multiple times. And then told to just smile and put upp a facade. Until finaly he breaks
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm expecting more before wathing this


Disappointed üò•üò•"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This trailer captures the decent into madness almost perfectly. It also ties into the theory that the joker was nobody before he became the joker. It's why no one can find his past. He was invisible until he arose as the joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Psychic spoiler alert! I think I see the joker killing Bruce Wayne's father n  mother at the end the movie and the little boy that the joker makes a smiley face on is Bruce Wayne as a little boy at Bruce Wayne's mansion!.. 100% right!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like crap
-_DJEzZk2pc,I very much hope there will be some violence....
-_DJEzZk2pc,This shit looks terrible
-_DJEzZk2pc,"just a sad movie, no because of the plot but because is garbage"
-_DJEzZk2pc,What's the name of the song towards the end
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks wack
-_DJEzZk2pc,fake jared leto is the joker for now and i think there is going to be an other movie with him
-_DJEzZk2pc,All it took was just one... bad... day.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Keep on smiling Phil Dunphy....
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I have one question
Where the f is Batman"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Am I the only one who got emotional after watching this? Mixed feelings brust thorugh by just watching him struggling to stay positive at the early parts of the trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This will be another DC's crap. 
Heath Leadger's Joker was so epic because we never found out about his background, about the story that drove him crazy, we only knew that he was crazy and wanted to destroy the system, that's what made him such an epic bad guy. Now, with his origin story this whole mystery goes into air."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow, Classic, tragic and dark. Good work."
-_DJEzZk2pc,It looks like an ICP video.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Like the grinch this joker seems to be a product of bullying
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I also had one of those moms who said, ‚ÄúYOU ONLY HAVE TO SHAVE UP TO YOUR KNEE!‚Äù -Amy Schumer ad before the video, that I‚Äôve seen so many times, and it make me facepalm every time."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It‚Äôs kinda sad actually. He was doing his best and was pursuing what he believed in and then people trashed him and beat him up. He lost faith in the people he was wanting to provide laughter to and cracked. 

Makes me respect people like teachers and police a little more."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie sucks
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm interested
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The most challenging role ever. Playing the joker. Just watchin the trailer, i do believe he nailed it!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Johnny cash is playing the Joker.
This is one that'll last."
-_DJEzZk2pc,How could a loser become a  mob boss. I guess I should watch the movie to find the answer.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Shit looks ass üëéüèæ
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Way to ruin the lore of the Joker. I don‚Äôt need to him to be a sympathetic character. He is a psychopath that is a trained killer, not a skinny, spindly man who looks like a breeze can knock him over. Not going to see this."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Best DC movie.... way better than Jared Leto
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wtf is this... The movie industry is going downhill so fast.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"A Puerto Rican playing a Joker, about time they spice it up. Born as Joaquin Rafael Bottom in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker is Good at this....anyways i feel bad for him....
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC takes things very seriously
-_DJEzZk2pc,He's a good Joker because he acts crazy in real life!  I like when he puts his  Dirty fingers in the kids mouth!  üò∑üòú

-_DJEzZk2pc,Epic fail
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath who? This guy is the one to make heaths performance look like a third grade soup and a show
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Noone can be better as Joker,as Heath Ledger was-sorry my personal meaning.Niemand wird den Joker je besser verk√∂rpern als Heath Ledger-meine Meinung"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Apart from Joaquin's impeccable acting, the Martin Scorsese vibe that this trailer gives off really adds to the appeal of this movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Cant wait
-_DJEzZk2pc,all it takes. is just one bad day
-_DJEzZk2pc,Still waiting for Willem Dafoe to be THE joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,One scene is enough . first scene that smile .. what an acting

-_DJEzZk2pc,A movie for gamers. Rise up.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The trailer looks great and dark, but ... well, I've seen a trailer that's look more great and darker than this ...
Named ""suicide squad"" üò≠üò≠"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Lets home this ushers in a new, realistic dc universe with more heartfelt, character based stories."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Daammmmmnn
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker just wanted to smile damn it
-_DJEzZk2pc,"jared leto would act the part of arthur fleck, in an exaggerated way, Joaquin does so calmly makes you feel sorry for him."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oooooh yeah! This looks like it‚Äôs going to eclipse even Heaths rendition...looking forward to this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This looks fucking horrible, hopefully it can prove me wrong."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Very orrible
-_DJEzZk2pc,No no no no NO!

-_DJEzZk2pc,"joaquin phoenix is one of the best actors ever and better than heath ledger. i dont like to compare 2 people playing the same character that much, but ledger could possibly get kicked of the throne as the best joker till now. heath ledger was crazy and nice to look at, but joaquin phoenix scares me, even if its only the trailer."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Is it just me..., or is Warner Bros getting crazier?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So, he becomes the Joker only to get beat up by Batman? He probably should have taken his life in a different direction."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I love it in the movie when he puts the smile on the young Bruce Wayne....after killing his parents.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dark knight still did it best but i will go see this because it has the joker back story

-_DJEzZk2pc,"It looks like 90 minutes leading up to 15 minutes of Joker going on a killing spree. Like someone else said, falling down reboot with the Joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Apparently he says the ""N"" word a lot in the movie. How do they get away with it?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Just realised there was nothing about the batman !!! Just the rise of the joker ???
-_DJEzZk2pc,my favorit villain.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks like shit lmfao
-_DJEzZk2pc,There can never be a better joker than Heath Ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,see?  now this is a good joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Taxi Driver 2: The Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,A comic book movie I might actually go see and appreciate. Whodathunk?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin Pheonix is a miles better actor than Ledger. this will be a good film i hope. if theyre rebooting batman, theyre going to have a tough time finding anyone to replace christian bale. the smartest thing they can do is bring bale back as the older batman. there is at least 2 more batman movies waiting to be made by bale."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now that's something I would go to cinema and watch.
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC is never gonna catch Mahvel... not like this... not like this...
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope this is more of a Taxi Driver movie than some kid's CGI filled garbage movie like they keep pumping out.
-_DJEzZk2pc,One of the most complex characters in modern literature to perform. AND FROM THE BODY LANGUAGE and EXPRESSIONS I SEE HERE Joaquin owns the role. I think he must be at the top few that can surpass Ledgers performance lets hope the director did not screw it up. PS Imagine Daniel day Lewis in that role
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope he doesn‚Äôt kill him self as Heath Ledger did
-_DJEzZk2pc,So this is the real origins
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Yikes, this looks.....amazing"
-_DJEzZk2pc,No no no no no no...DC drama movie? No thanks
-_DJEzZk2pc,Amazing but I will see a batman collabo :(
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The first problem i see is that they are giving joker a backstory. The point of the character is that he doesn't have one, he just is. The second problem is that he is out of his makeup, you're not supposed to do that. The third problem, is that it is a DC movie, and we all know what that means..."

-_DJEzZk2pc,Will DC choke again stay tuned!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Making this film was a waste of time and money. The only people that will see it are the 40 year olds who are still living in their parents basement. Lame, lame, lame."

-_DJEzZk2pc,"This looks absolutely amazing, Phoenix is such a good actor. Mind you I they got me last time with the Suicide Squad trailer. I thought that looked amazing also but was quite disappointed when I watched it."
-_DJEzZk2pc,2:12 the unmistakable swagger of Joaquin
-_DJEzZk2pc,Christopher Nolan proved that the joker doesn't need an origin story. Still happy to see this though.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This isn't an accurate movie because if you recall. The joker tells his story in Batman the dark knight. He says he got like that coz of his wife not mom.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Any one from telengana
-_DJEzZk2pc,"LOVE THIS TRAILER.
I HATE CAPTAIN  MARVEL"

-_DJEzZk2pc,Where is the evil and mind blowing plan? No explosions? No banks on fire?? No dead people? Geeeezz

-_DJEzZk2pc,Just another overrated movie..
-_DJEzZk2pc,"That actually looks frickin cool, I'm sure he is an amazing actor but movie can be shit and that's what I'm afraid of"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Did anyone notice that when he walked up the stairs he still was sane  but the more he walked down the stairs He got insane and finally when he reached the bottom he was insane.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So leaks that came out last year seem to be true, don't know how to feel about that if it all actually happens but I'm still very excited"

Instead of going after the tooth fairy in darkness falls,  punishment/justice should be exacted on the townsfolk who made a mistake.   Instead of going after Jason,  they should be getting rid of anyone who was involved/connected to his wrongful death.  
There are many people who become older and are sorry now, but definitely were not sorry before.  Those people should be made to endure a 1000 years of misery and pain that would make pinhead from hellraiser smile."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I didn't like it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I had an ad for another movie before this trailer so I thought I was watching the Joker movie trailer and it would suck until I saw the skip button after a minute.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The joker is a good guy
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please just stop with the remakes
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I am super interested, but I've noticed something odd. Maybe its just an issue with me but like every trailer I've seen in the modern day feels very awkward."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"First time i got emotional over a trailer, fk those bastards i'm rooting for Joker tbh. 
wouldn't it be crazy if Arthur became friends with Bruce and thats the reason why batman doesn't kill the other Joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I hope the film lives up to the trailer. This is closer to my idea of the Joker than I've seen in film before. Heath Ledger put in an awesome performance as a psychopathic criminal but was very one dimensional. He had no explosion of high paced, shrill, madness. To me, he just didn't convey the Joker. Fingers crossed on this one ü§û"

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Look, I think this actor did a great job in the movie Gladiator, but, that was nineteen years ago. Smoking crack and loosing weight does not a Joker make. Joker is a bad ass, his girlfriend, Harley, another bad ass. His make up, childish. His suit, Salvation Army. My Joker doesn‚Äôt wear two dollar suits. My joker wear crazys fricken make up, not mister Rogers clown impersonation make up. Yes we all know the origin story ‚ÄúOrigin‚Äù Mr. President, not oranges. Joker was a poor comic, he made a wrong decision out of desperation and shit went sideways and falling into the chemicals, but, the joker, comes out of the tank a criminal mastermind taking down scores that easily buys him Armani suits and yeah, CrAzY. Joaquin Phoenix makes the Joker look like Napoleon Dynamite as a grandpa. Yes, I‚Äôm going to see it, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a movie about my fav character!‚Äù But, I‚Äôm not liking anything I‚Äôve seen in this trailer...wee, ya got the iconic staircase from the movie the Exorcist, cool. Rolls eyes. This movie is super focused on showing how much effort the actor put into loosing weight for the roll and maybe he finally shaved off that Virginian mountain man beard, but they overkill that aspect. I don‚Äôt care to see his pathetic self dancing with his mommy. I don‚Äôt wish to see him dancing in front of a mirror in his dirty fruit of the looms. He looks more like a skinny John Wayne Gacy, than he does the Joker. Batman‚Äôs nemesis, the Joker. The one villain who always is a handful for Bats. Y‚Äôall took that joker and turned him into a piss smelling, crack smoking, subway riding mumbling to himself in the corner and he apparently did some horrible deed in the movie. Can we just make a deal, let‚Äôs give him the Oscar for smoking crack to loose weight for the roll, but, we all will simply just watch The Dark Night instead and while I‚Äôm bitching...Jared Leto, your desperate attempt to seem crazy, was just that...desperate. Crazy knows crazy and we all respect it...I have none for Joaquin or Jared. I‚Äôd rather chop off my fingers and toes as I‚Äôm forced to sit through another screening of Aquaman."

-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel like I'm the only one who's very weary of this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Why make a movie about the joker, when you can see everything in detail in ""Gotham""?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can't wait. I hope he does right by Heath Ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,where are his mouth scars
-_DJEzZk2pc,Definitely 2020 Acedemy award for you joaquin phoenix...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Heath ledger: Why so serious ? 
Joker: üò®"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If your familiar with the killing joke movie, this looks similar the joker in that was just straight up depressed and hated the world üòÇ this should be great üòç"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Modern family...to this.....he cabt be the new or AN new joker...but still im gonna watch this
-_DJEzZk2pc,The trailer isnt the best. But i know Pheonix is an extremely emotional actor so this movie is going to be a real hard hitter not your typical butman shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,Good GOD this looks AWFUL.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I want to see it asap
-_DJEzZk2pc,just not with that it factor.  it seems ok tho.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I thought joker cut the side of his lips to make them wider and more red
-_DJEzZk2pc,I already have such a deep connection and understanding with this trailer. I really can‚Äôt imagine how hard the movie is going to hit me
-_DJEzZk2pc,"i wish he gets a healthy life after performing this joker character. This character is very deep, sad, intense and mad."
-_DJEzZk2pc,*goosebumps*
-_DJEzZk2pc,So this is Joker's real master??? Because young bruce is therein one of the clips
-_DJEzZk2pc,they better not suicide squad this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why he look so werid shirtless
-_DJEzZk2pc,"looks like inspiration for another white supremist mass murder. thanks hollywood, always in touch with the times."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I smell an Oscar
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Oh no....they put that Marxist p.o.s. DeNiro in the film. This is going to ruin the film. Plus, a Joker origin story without Batman is just wrong."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks promising
-_DJEzZk2pc,It looks ok. Not really interested
-_DJEzZk2pc,WowüòØ
-_DJEzZk2pc,i can't wait too watch this
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If Ledger hadn't died, the character of Joker would have gotten his own movie way early I think.

Anyway, Joaquin is a brilliant actor and I expect this movie to be a blockbuster! Can't wait"
-_DJEzZk2pc,So far this is making joker look like a punk which is bogusüòí
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's like a torch got passed from Dark Knight or something....cause Jacquin Pheonix a good ass actor too.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why is his belly and back so skinny and strange?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I‚Äôm just going to hold any thought till after I see the movie, trailer looks amazing but suicide squad did the same thing and that movie wasn‚Äôt as good as they could have made it, but I have high hopes"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heaths.... The iconic joker.. Forever..... Leto... Failed
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I am obsessed with the trailer. Watched it like 20 times. Artistic excellence, every frame is a diamond."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is stupid... No joker better than the legendary one the real life joker ..the dark knight.. Joker is here..
-_DJEzZk2pc,I haven't been to the theater for a comic book movie since The Dark knight. I'd go see this. I have a feeling this is gonna be a massive hit for DC. Not your average comic book film.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope the the movie is actually better than the trailers
-_DJEzZk2pc,Well that looks like crap.
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:08
-_DJEzZk2pc,Cool
-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôm not feeling this movie. There is not enough darkness in jokers character
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm not feeling it... it's a new age joker? Looks very dark, but not much else... how does this lead to an insane criminal mastermind... I'll wait till some reviews come out. So far it looks like a pass to me. But we shall see."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Except for the Nolan's Batman trilogy, super-heroes movies give me nausea! They are the most despicable hypocritical garbage of today's cinema! However, this trailer sends shivers down my spine and also because of De Niro's role and Chaplin's genius music, I'll definitely see it! I truly hope it won't be disappointing, in the end!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,April fools
-_DJEzZk2pc,The perfect song for the film : https://youtu.be/6E2hYDIFDIU
-_DJEzZk2pc,@0:13 that shot of him walking just screams JOKER
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:51 Bruce Wayne
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm glad that Joaquin Phoenix is acting again, he's a terrific actor."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks awful
-_DJEzZk2pc,Somewhere an Oscar is being carved with Joaquins name on it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like another DC flop to me
-_DJEzZk2pc,*Batman has left the chat*
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This has the novel like feel of The Watchmen.
This now taps into the Batman ""Dark Knight"" style."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"this look like a super fail, after batman: dark knight they want to roborn the joker, but the joker only work with batman in the movie"
-_DJEzZk2pc,trailer was literally the ad for the video
-_DJEzZk2pc,disgusting
-_DJEzZk2pc,this better be good
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Now, that is my kind of Joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,imagine heath ledger in this movie! RIP BEST JOKER EVER!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh please make this great!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"oh, so in THIS universe THIS Joker settles issues with DANCE!
0:30 - sometimes on sidewalks, 0:49 - sometimes with his mother,  1:44 - sometimes semi-nude in restrooms, 2:00 - behind curtains,  2:16 - sometimes on stairways"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is insane...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can. not. wait.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think we have a new #1 Villian. A new #1 Joker. Joaquin Pheonix where the hell you been for the last 20 years???  This was what we wanted from you...Thank you!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nah
-_DJEzZk2pc,Every bad guy starts off good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow a dc movie that IS good??????
-_DJEzZk2pc,I just got the trailer(ad) for this trailer...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Would you like fries with that ma‚Äôam
-_DJEzZk2pc,Damn the should've kept the original look with the purple coat and rough painted mask
-_DJEzZk2pc,"DC And Warner embracing the true grind of what they should be together... Dark, gritty, deep and a spoonful of suspense. 


Now we're cooking."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"All Joaquin phoenix is as the joker is a wannabe that looks like a member of The Insane Clown Posse, this isn't even The Joker, it's the shittest thing I've ever seen, they should of kept Jarod Leto as The Joker, at least he was good unlike this new bitch version of him, Joker is nobody without Batman & Harley Quinn anyways, and btw Heath Ledger is shit too"
-_DJEzZk2pc,‡πÑ‡∏°‡πà‡∏ä‡∏≠‡∏ö‡πÄ‡∏ß‡∏≠‡∏£‡πå‡∏ä‡∏±‡πà‡∏ô Joker ‡∏ô‡∏µ‡πâ‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏¢
-_DJEzZk2pc,"You KNOW that somewhere Jack Nicholson is saying ""Oh shit... What have I done?"" LOL"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"He looks like an okay Joker, but his laugh felt forced, tbh the best Joker that ever was or will be was Heath Ledger, and Jack Nicholson a close 2nd."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is going to be deep and dark. You are going to feel sorry for him in one moment, and yet a second after, you are going to be afraid of him. This is going to be far more than just a comic movie. Actually this being a comic movie, will kinda negotiate it's glory, while at the same time, no one is going to see comic movies in the light, like we did till nowadays. It's going to be about real things, every one of us knows. This is going to be one of the most memorable movies ever. It will be mentioned in all top movies ranks, next to citizen kane etc, from now on. Joaquin is the real deal for this role. He is going to redifine the joker. You will see."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Holy hell i am motivated for this movie. That is a very different trailer from the others movies , no explosion , no epic battles , and that's GOOD. I expect a lot from this movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oscar for sure.
-_DJEzZk2pc,CREEPY AF!!! I'm not watching this without my Boyz with me.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Man... that looks dark!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Great another film about a man going insane to become a crazed psychotic
-_DJEzZk2pc,utter garbage... this is not the joker we all love.. this is some kind of money grab off the franchise stop remaking shit make better charcters not ones that make no fucking sense like this one
-_DJEzZk2pc,"at 2:06     it's ,   The Crow .."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Humanizing criminals now? This seems ridiculous
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Such large shoes to fill, not quite bought in. Hummmm"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Damn! He had one big underwear on 1:55
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is the movie that I've been looking for... I thought avengers is the best movie this year but after I watch this trailer It made me realize that avengers are for kids only.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin should be amazing in this, but as a lifelong fan I'm not happy it's an origin story."
-_DJEzZk2pc,heath gonna be so happy to see this in HEAVENüëç
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:07 that laugh sold me
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks Oscar worthy!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Another piece of shit DC movie.  Sad.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I wasn't excited for this film at all until seeing the trailer. It looks fantastic.  Can't wait to see it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The dark night king is back .
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker is the most iconic character in comic book history.
-_DJEzZk2pc,No bullshit SJW Agenda is this film
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm not feelin the eye makeup.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is Michael Jackson's favorite song.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel sorry for joker past
-_DJEzZk2pc,When your at a low in movie stardom just play the joker to try and be famouse again cowboy butt sex did and look how amazing and famouse he become lol
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I wont lie, if this was the joker from suicide squad i would definitely watch it but this looks like shit. 100% cheap actor and looks"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wooow, Phoenix as the Joker is incredible! Two of the greatest will for ever be Jack Nicholson and Joaquin Phoenix"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Perfect trailer. No plot points or key scenes revealed, just a visual tone and hint of character teased."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This could be the best joker yet
-_DJEzZk2pc,I am waiting
-_DJEzZk2pc,I thought he was dead didn't maximus killed him?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin can pull it off.  Can't think of anyone better
-_DJEzZk2pc,Booooo.  One of the greatest mysteries about the joker is NOT knowing his origin.  Him just being a product of people treating him badly doesn‚Äôt do it justice.
-_DJEzZk2pc,If you can not find your fans just find your haters ^_^
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm just gonna keep watching this trailer until October.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This one sucks
-_DJEzZk2pc,Rip nippsey
-_DJEzZk2pc,What makes the Joker so dangerous is that not only is he insane but he's also a brilliant mastermind strategist and a clever manipulator.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"this almost seems like it has nothing to do with batman.im not saying it doesnt but for the first half i thought it was just called joker because its about a guy who dresses like a clown and then goes insane (not the batman villain), i dont know if that is a good or bad thing i guess will have to see but it does look interesting."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wish Heath ledger played this....
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not better than heath ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin is finally gonna get his Oscar..it‚Äôs absurd he hasn‚Äôt won one already
-_DJEzZk2pc,This was the first time I‚Äôve felt bad for joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The joker has to be one of the hardest roles to take.  If he pulls it off, he‚Äôs gunna be a rich man."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I get why Bruce wanted kill him
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope it's don't cross really the dark knight's story
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Who else watched ""Master""...?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath leager will be the best joker ever. RIP ‚ù§Ô∏è
-_DJEzZk2pc,Awwww poor satanic clown gets beaten up.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Did they just make the Joker the good guy?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Would've been cool if his clothes got like progressivley darker through the trailer and his voice more emotive to show how much he changed at each point
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie will suck and I honestly want to know who is signing off on this sh.....
-_DJEzZk2pc,1 big mistake where are Jokers scars we all know how he got them while he was a kid by his fatrhers hand....why so  serious?
-_DJEzZk2pc,That stride at @2.11 though....
-_DJEzZk2pc,YES! Fucking YES! I was waiting for something like this. The only movie I've been so excited to watch. Joker is my favorite character in all comic books. There is a reason I have him inked on my arm for the rest of my life. JOKER FOR 2020!!!!!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:26 THIS IS HOW JOKER LAUGH
-_DJEzZk2pc,this shit is so trash.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now you see...
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:51 Who is ? Bruce Wayne ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Very VERY big meh
-_DJEzZk2pc,"YO! If you‚Äôre going to come behind Heath Ledger‚Äôs legendary performance, THIS is how you do it!! üòçüòç #Wow!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ugh. How many times do you have to see Hollywood retell, remake, refurbish original work? Is there any creativity left in Hollywood or are they too busy being political activists? 
Quit rehashing old work and create something new, original. America has tired of your political activism and lack of originality and creativity."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think Im gonna like this new joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,I like all of the jokers but I think that this joker is going to be spectacular
-_DJEzZk2pc,Doesn't look great. I'll check it though.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The best thing about this trailer is the complete absence of Jared Leto.
-_DJEzZk2pc,BADASSSS
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks good. Hopefully it won't be shit. That's a good joker laugh however so there's promise
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Only gonna be one of these, no sequels...I'm not gonna watch and enjoy it....just to know there will never be another"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Anyone else see half of the ATL cast in this movie trailer? :)
-_DJEzZk2pc,üî•üî•üî•...This movie is going to break records üíØ
-_DJEzZk2pc,Meh
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Just hope it's nothing like ""The Master"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,I so hope that this is awesome.
-_DJEzZk2pc,What if he went to the Wayne manor after hearing about the deaths and went to try to make him Happy
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin Phoenix looks like he's gonna do amazing as the Joker. I can't wait to see the movie. But for me Heath Ledger will always be my number 1 Clown. Also, did anyone else feel like they were about to cry for Joker at 0:30?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I used to think that my life was a tragedy,
But now i realize, it's a comedy
-Joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,You either die as a hero or you see yourself become the villain someday.
-_DJEzZk2pc,What was that the dark knight joker with heath ledger is so much better
-_DJEzZk2pc,He's perfect for this role cause he can just b himself!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hilarious. It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs trying to make me feel sympathy for a villain. Fucking Hollywood is a joke.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gamers rise up
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gay.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This doesn‚Äôt seem like a DC movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Other than Christopher Nolan's Batman movies, DC is just dropping the ball. Yeah, we all know Joaquin is a great actor, but even he can save a shitty script on his own."
-_DJEzZk2pc,After heath these will always suck
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie will be just as good as the dark knight! Heath ledger would be proud
-_DJEzZk2pc,If this movie focuses on the fucked up past of the joker and gets an R rating it will be amazing
-_DJEzZk2pc,i look forward to this more than the avengers.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The story make me cry.... You're the best Joaquin Phoenix!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I guess everyone thoughts will change a lot about Joker after watching this movie...what do u think üòâ
-_DJEzZk2pc,I wana wach
-_DJEzZk2pc,2: 41 is so lit the way he does the action
-_DJEzZk2pc,This nigga needs a chiropractor
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like a filthy Carney............fail
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Can't wait, this is the only reason why i want to keep living at least til october"
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:27 this shot looks similar to the shot in TDK when Batman punched Joker and he kept laughing
-_DJEzZk2pc,That laugh üî•üî•üî•üî•
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I hope that clown makeup isn't his final form. Joker isnt that gaudy. He creates spectacle, he is not a spectacle himself."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why gotta make Bruce so young and joker so old
-_DJEzZk2pc,Johnny cash really let himself go
-_DJEzZk2pc,I LOVE YOU MISTA J <3
-_DJEzZk2pc,Better than that fk tard Jared Leto that guy made the look dumb asf.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks like shit, nuff said."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I have never related to a character as much as I do to him and that's quite terrifying considering he's gonna be the joker but trying to force yourself to be a happy person when your life is falling apart more and more every day.... THATS MY FUCKING LIFE. The scene where he's in makeup room trying to force himself to smile but he's crying is a very on the nose representation of that. Most people don't have the balls to make a serial killer this crazy actually relatable
-_DJEzZk2pc,If batman has trouble keeping the joker down why does he not ask help from the avengers?!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Been over a decade since the last joker magic... and this one comes as a perfect sibling... Joker returns as I would have never thought of... How far is October??
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nutz
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is what the DCU needs.  They need to humanize the antagonist,  allow us to develop a relationship with the character,  let us see the world through his eyes and emotions. 

Already,  they're showing us this man with a mental illness getting treatment, having a loving/ caring mother,  experiencing happiness and joy,  only to have it all be turned on its head by the greater society as a whole,  personal loss,  pain and suffering,  and a spiral into crazy town. 

Loving it already,  can't wait to see it."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This guy should've played the governor in twd
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hope his character feels like John doe did. This is going to be a good movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yo Johnny cash is the joker like of you get the reference
-_DJEzZk2pc,"wow, wasn't really expecting this kinda film... Seems like its gonna be more on par with Silence of the Lambs than your typical DC film... interesting.."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Mark Hamill, Heath Ledger and now Joaquin Phoenix...the three jokers."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I haven't seen a movie at theaters in eight years. I'm going for this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,There is such a thing as too much character development
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now DC needs a Batman!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I don't know why, but I'm kinda getting Clockwork Orange vibes from this..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Thank you DC! This looks amazing. The Joker is such an interesting character.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Shazam and this have given me hope for the dceu
-_DJEzZk2pc,Me huele a dolor mucho dolor
-_DJEzZk2pc,GAMERS RISE UP!!!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I gave myself a thumbs up to get 1 like!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The trailer is so good. Also, the song SMILE BY MICHAEL JACKSON! There goes my heart. ""Mute MJ""?! STFU!! LEGENDS CAN NEVER BE MUTED. LOVE YOU MICHAEL. R.I.P.üíïüôèüëë WE KNOW YOU WERE, ARE AND WILL ALWAYS BE INNOCENT"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Phoenix is a incredible actor.  I'll spend my money to see this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,We all have that breaking point its the feeling of anger that has gone too far.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I dont get ir
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks stupid. Plus they should of picked a better actor. And went a different route in terms of dark deep
-_DJEzZk2pc,What a body transformation for the role he was literally skin & bones
-_DJEzZk2pc,This actually looks terrible.  With no antagonist this is a pointless cash grab by DC.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This actor is a hundred times better than the suicide squad one
-_DJEzZk2pc,looks gay. it's going to be retarded and a waste of time. it will be pretentious. a self fellating snooze fest.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is a weird remake of The Day the Clown Cried...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Maybe we'll see how he got those scarsüòâ
-_DJEzZk2pc,..All we had to do was laugh at his jokes...now we done fucked up.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm Batman.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This has a lot of promise, it could be like the new venom movie which gives me hope"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nobody asked for joker's history.  We love the character and we don't want to know why / how he became joker. It looks depressing enough to empathize with a demonic character.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Could this be the next best joker?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Who else thinks that the kid in the cemetery that the joker tries to put a smile on - is Bruce Wayne visiting his parents' grave?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Just another damn old Joker movie... I just hope it don't motivate those damn nutcases to go out and shoot up a bunch of people again, so the damn liberals can have a another field day over it again..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,He might win the best actor award for this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ive always wonder what drove the joker to be dat crazy
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not feeling it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Laugh is good not sure how I feel about the rest the clown makeup too cheesy
-_DJEzZk2pc,And what do we do with societies?
-_DJEzZk2pc,anybody thinks at some point he will snap and kill his mother and that will be one of the things that turns him into the joker?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now THIS is a comic based flick I will actually see. Looks incredibly dark.
-_DJEzZk2pc,CRINGE
-_DJEzZk2pc,I... I can't fucking wait for this movie!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"WOOOOOOOO this is simply incredible, wow, long time i dont see a so good trailer of any shit like this, i saw it with a big interest in every second, waiting for a shit like Shazam or Capt Marvel or Wonder Woman or queer movies like that, but second after second and in a moment the music began to sound with the sinister chords of the Batman movies, and in that exact moment the Joker walk in front of us, hahahaha hey this shit promise be A CLASSIC OF ALL TIMES, im impressed, so good, WE NEED GOOD MOVIES, MOTHERFUCKERS OF HOLLYJEWS, and nobody better than Joaquin Phoenix to replace the real Joker of Nolan trilogy, hahahhaha i need to watch this movie, maybe will be a real crap, but maybe will be ONE OF THE BEST"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Well no wonder he went crazy. People keep beating the shit outta him for no reason.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like shite
-_DJEzZk2pc,That trailer gave me zero desire to watch this movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Im not a d.c but this looks amazing
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie looks inspirational for borderline insane people. Don't portray monsters as heros!!! That too of a comic story!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"There is one thing bothering me:
WHY IS THE SUIT NOT PURPLE!? Everything else is perfect"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Question!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm calling it. His mother dies and that's the trigger for his descent into madness since it seems she was the only thing keeping his sanity in check by the way he talks about her. Him washing her is a clear sign that she is in failing health. He talks about her telling him stuff in the past tense which he wouldnt if she was alive.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Iam a real life üÉè
-_DJEzZk2pc,am I the only one who feels bad for what Joker has gone through?
-_DJEzZk2pc,good choice for the leading actor
-_DJEzZk2pc,He skinny as frick
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Yup, I'm sold!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Somewhere Jerod Leto is pissed AF...
-_DJEzZk2pc,He had a bad day and he found a way to nake it better.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"What the f***, they turn the Batman into some kind of psychotic bulshit"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Now this is good because if they portray the joker like they should, as a dark, gritty, and insane maniac like they‚Äôre setting this up and the movie starts getting controversial and fucked up the media will go crazy and be so torn over this"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Bruce wayne at 1:51 ??
-_DJEzZk2pc,Your just good to be true cant take my eyes off you
-_DJEzZk2pc,"OK this seems darkly promising, or promisingly dark, whatever"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Yep, this will get me to the theater."
-_DJEzZk2pc,atleast we dont have that actor who played joker in the suicide squad
-_DJEzZk2pc,Jared leto is quaking
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm kinda getting a clockwork orange vibe from this. Is this rated R?
-_DJEzZk2pc,So hyped I cannot wait to see this movie. He is contending for the crown for best actor whoever played the Joker. Not saying he is prevailing. My opinion that Heath Ledger as of now is the best actor to portray the Joker. We will have to see how Joaquin Phoenix preforms.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow I am truly impressed by Joaquin's acting
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yoooooooo I genuinely cant wait for this....    finally a good joker idk if this is the old joker actor but i really hope the crazy funny joker will still be there
-_DJEzZk2pc,5th 6th time..... Regurgitating
-_DJEzZk2pc,this looks to boring without enough murder and action
-_DJEzZk2pc,Old joker not the new one... i love ha
-_DJEzZk2pc,WE
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Oh wow, this actually looks good O_0"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Yup,  I'm going to watch it"
-_DJEzZk2pc,How many times are they going to ruin the Batman franchise with shit like this.  Just stop already.
-_DJEzZk2pc,There were no knives or guns in the trailer.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks shitty as fuck
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If this movie isn't rated R then my jammies will surely be ruffled, still gonna see it though."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hmmm.... Charles Manson would have been a better actor üòï
-_DJEzZk2pc,we live in a society where the sick are called normal and the intelligent are called crazy
-_DJEzZk2pc,Cringey
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks stupid, worst joker I have ever seen. And I love Joaquin Phoenix as an actor but he is no joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I may not be a big fan of his but he dives deep into his roles and this looks awesome
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks REALLY good. Looks like a great performance from Jaoquin.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like another sucky movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,I like the fact.it doesnt.seem like its your usual comic book adapation.its done with style and originality and its about.time!
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:09
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If this is going to be half as good as the dark knight was he needs to be just as evil and cruel as Heath ledger was in his performance, and not just in his attitude. If I‚Äôm going to be completely honest I didn‚Äôt like the trailer a whole lot. I think it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt know what kind of a joker he‚Äôs going to be and they‚Äôre showing him off as if he‚Äôs already earned the intense fear you would have seeing heath ledger and in my opinion he hasn‚Äôt. I think this definitely has a lot of potential and it‚Äôs either going to be really really good or just not what people were looking for when they heard ‚Äúa joker movie‚Äù I hope it‚Äôs really good, but was kind of disappointed in this trailer, hopefully the movie isn‚Äôt truly reflected by this trailer and they just aren‚Äôt showing us a ton of other stuff like most trailers seem to do these days which I think would be really cool and good for a change because there‚Äôs not much of that anymore, most of the time if you watch a trailer you‚Äôve pretty much seen the movie. Or at least that‚Äôs what it seems like. Best of luck to them though, I‚Äôm excited to see how it turns out."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Once upon a time we had crazy clown shenanigans in the streets. Is this going to be the catalyst for round 2...?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm glad that based on the trailer, there is no CGI, but if he doesn't announce that we live in a society in the film I will start a riot"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ehhhh.... I mean... I guess. But wasn't he already a villain before he became the joker in the comics?
-_DJEzZk2pc,okay but its not health ledger and i cant get past that
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is upsetting this is the worst joker ever
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nope
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think we are going to see  Joaquin deliver a performance that will go down in History as one of the finest perfomances ever on screen.   His entire transformation and demeanor as The Joker is going to Shock the World..I predict.  We will be witness to greatness...I feel it.  Joaquin will set a new standard.
-_DJEzZk2pc,William Defoe should have gotten the role tbh
-_DJEzZk2pc,Damn... we really need to rise up.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow this looks retarded
-_DJEzZk2pc,At 1:35 ....I don't know why but that shot doesn't look like an actor portraying the Joker to me. It is the Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,How could joaquin pull that loud laugh like that? Awesome!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Thos looks like shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm not sure I like how we get to see the joker before he was the joker because it's always been a mystery for we i was and i liked that
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh god. They are gonna make me empathize for Joker aren‚Äôt they...... dear god the madmen
-_DJEzZk2pc,What happened with the part with his dad cutting a smile on his face
-_DJEzZk2pc,I almost cried when those guys took his sign üò¢
-_DJEzZk2pc,Pass..
-_DJEzZk2pc,like the actor
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks horrible
-_DJEzZk2pc,If a clown's face paint comes to a point it symbolizes evil.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Well this looks boring.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can‚Äôt believe they‚Äôre insulting the joker with such a horrible actor playing him that ruined the whole movie for me
-_DJEzZk2pc,Eh.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yep I am going to see this. Look cinema have my seat ready...
-_DJEzZk2pc,What a joke.
-_DJEzZk2pc,2.5k downvotes were from hoes and dumbasses in abusive relationships.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Cre√≥ qu√© ya lleg√≥ la verdadera pel√≠cula del a√±o, y por fin se acabar√° toda esa mierda de Marvel"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Excellent casting choice, this should be great. Though I highly doubt anyone can ever dethrone Jack Nicholson, his performance was too perfect."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Im confused, what universe is this !"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I thought that the joker killed his mom when he was a teen at the circus. Atleast from the Gotham series that‚Äôs what I got
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Phoenix was SUPER creepy in Gladiator and that character IMO stole the show (yes I get all the women wanted to F Crowe, who had fairly stale acting). This should be good. And thank God we're getting an origin story about a villain that MAY make us sympathize? That's the F'd up part... but I'm so tired of the MU Disney PC/recycled same story bullshit Universe.... Just finish Avengers and then die in a fire."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Big shoes to fill man, good luck"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yay something other than a disney Marvel movie. Death to Disney
-_DJEzZk2pc,unpopular opinion: DC should keep making movies about villains and anti-heroism
-_DJEzZk2pc,I wonder why his cleft lip wasn‚Äôt a part of the joker‚Äôs character
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks good but I would have loved to see where Jared Leto could have taken it
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where's harley? She needs a movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,The movie industry is fucking pathetic. They lack so much ingenuity that they feel it necessary to destroy classic stories and characters.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Cool film
-_DJEzZk2pc,Complete garbage
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Society gave us *The joker*

Criminals made Batman"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin Phoenix is the right type of actor to pull off a Joker, depending on how well this film is written he could potentially be as good a Joker as Nicholson, Ledger and Hamill. Though that won't be an easy feat, but it looks very promising."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger :(
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why do I feel like this is one of jokers origin stories to harley before she worked for the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,River Phoenix is a better actor
-_DJEzZk2pc,ÿßŸá ÿßŸÑÿÆÿ±ÿß ÿØŸä
-_DJEzZk2pc,Badass actor he‚Äôs awesome
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can't stand this freak. will not see this because of him.
-_DJEzZk2pc,WE FINALLY HAVE A CANON JOKER CHILDHOOD STORY?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Anyone else praying that Joaquin Phoenix doesn't go completely insane and kill himself
-_DJEzZk2pc,man there jurk's to joker :(
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Heath Ledger is the best joker ever, no one will ever come close to him"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is shit.. What the fuck. Hell no I'm not happy at all. I love DC but this is not his story at all. Why do they have to do this to him. Not going to see this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is it possible? Could they have made a good DC film? üò±
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can't wait
-_DJEzZk2pc,My Favourite Villain ‚ù§Ô∏è I hope this movie gets Fuckn weird and deranged üò¨
-_DJEzZk2pc,"nothin against this guy or his depiction the joker but, from what im getting of this origin story, its fuckin weak. its a dressed up version of a ""we live in a society"" meme on r/im14andthisisdeep :/"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Sorry Mr. Phoenix, Heath Ledger version is better...Heath, heath, heath, heath..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I really don't think a better actor today could do The Joker.  Good for DC.  I hope this movie is as good as it seems.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If he doesnt bring back the ""you wanna know how i got these scars?"" line im gonna shit in your mouth"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dark ü§ôüèΩ
-_DJEzZk2pc,Chills
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can someone tell me what happened to the suicide squad joker.  Did they reboot him
-_DJEzZk2pc,too soon bro...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Insert Willem Dafoe here ^^^^^^^
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not going to lie I got goosebumps when I saw the green hair
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ending song??
-_DJEzZk2pc,bruh wtf
-_DJEzZk2pc,Impressive
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now we don‚Äôt have to pay since we just watched the whole movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,this is the unofficial trailer it's just a copy of the actual teaser trailer the actual trailers are on DC's Youtube channel and Warner Bros YouTube channel
-_DJEzZk2pc,So dark as I expected.
-_DJEzZk2pc,*the trailer made me feel kinda bad for joker*
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin stars in your favorite movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Œ§his looks like shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,Pretty sure this movie retarded.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Soundtrack?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is it rated r or rated PG or rated PG13
-_DJEzZk2pc,Im only hope that joker get revenge from the ones who smash the wood ad in his face
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is one of those trailers where they basically show the whole movie so there‚Äôs no point of seeing since they showed the best scenes LOL I wouldn‚Äôt have no interest in it but since they did add Joaquin Phoenix in it I might watch it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"As excited as I am, I do wish that this movie had a more creative title."
-_DJEzZk2pc,THE SMILE THO. CREEPY AS FAAAAAAAACK :(
-_DJEzZk2pc,Great another movie with the joker...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"unpopular opinion: I really liked man of steel 

I have been waiting for something like this"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Complete shit to retcon joker without mentioning his time as the red hood.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"We live in a society. Say the N word, gamers"
-_DJEzZk2pc,looks like samuel adams ..( the guy on the beer bottle)
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin looks great. Story looks terrible. No thanks.
-_DJEzZk2pc,If only it was heath leadger
-_DJEzZk2pc,Only Phoenix is worthy to step into Ledger's role...imho
-_DJEzZk2pc,Thise Joker will be next to Heath...If not better :)

-_DJEzZk2pc,FUCKING GAY
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC is killing it since marvel went full retar........er......full SJW
-_DJEzZk2pc,JOAQUIN  is a stellar actor he doesn't need so many trailers.  This is a man who gives the camera what it needs  he has talent and an amazing craft.
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:18 That Laughing is lit....
-_DJEzZk2pc,Comedy is right. Will anyone ever save us from Hollywood? Omg
-_DJEzZk2pc,From Heath to Joaquin

-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally the joker is bake on track ;) last one in sq was straight ass
-_DJEzZk2pc,this actually made me feel sad for him
-_DJEzZk2pc,So far I don‚Äôt see a plot....
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can this finally be the Joker to match Heath Ledgers Joker?
-_DJEzZk2pc,2:17 shinsuke nakamura??
-_DJEzZk2pc,The best part about the joker is that he didn‚Äôt have a back story and no real motive as to why he was and what made him that way. A mentally ill mamas boy is not a good back story.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Bro this makes me feel bad for joker...wtf
-_DJEzZk2pc,What doesn‚Äôt kill you makes you stranger~
-_DJEzZk2pc,no se ..me da algo de tristeza  y tan solo es el trailer....se nota que estara buena buenisima
-_DJEzZk2pc,Another trash from DC.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel bad for him 0:30
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Fuck this crappy ass Joker.
The real Jokers skin is bleached from a chemical burn not make up.
Garbage ass trailer."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Plz tell me Christian  Bale is batman again
-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôm addicted to this trailer. I hope they don‚Äôt release another one this is perfect.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I thought joker got his white face by dropping into some kind of chemical factory????
-_DJEzZk2pc,Holy this going to be dark
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Amazing twist to the joker origin from the look of it, the make up looks a but if but the complete look is badass. The actor does a good joker laugh(which is hard to come by)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,River would be so effin proud of his baby brother. Oh my gah.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wasn‚Äôt he a rapper?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Literally no one 
Me: AHHHHH! THIS LOOKS SO GOOD! IM SO EXCITED! DID U SEE THE TRAILER"
-_DJEzZk2pc,It looks like there did everything as wrong as possible üòë
-_DJEzZk2pc,"basically, it will always be because of the society that we are fuccccced"
-_DJEzZk2pc,It looks like a good movie but it doesn‚Äôt look like a good ‚ÄúJoker‚Äù movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Its rated R right ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow it looks like from the comment section I'm the only one that thinks this looks like fucking garbage but hey 90%of all the comic book movies are fucking garbage and I see that won't change so I won't watch what happened to real movies
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Oh My God , that song along with perfect directing and JOKERü§° it'll be a Masterpiece üíô"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Take notes marvel
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope they do the original origin story. He was a failed Comedian. Who had a pregnant wife. The bottle heater blow up and killed her and the baby. At that same moment he was the red hood and he fell into the chemicals. After getting taking off his mask he look like a clown and then when he got the news he broke.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this the same world as suicide squad? Sorry if I'm asking a stupid question
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The idea of a film surrounding 'the antagonist' is usually met with a lot of skepticism ...but this looks like it can definitely hold an audience. Can't wait!!! I just hope it isn't TOO sad, hyper-real, disturbingly dark, etc. The disabled mother thing seems a lot"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I like how every actor who has ever played the Joker puts a different spin on it.  Even Leto's Joker is unique even if SS was a mess.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Damn. This is amazing. Please give us more of these movies.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ugly.  Violent.  One Joke Joker.  The Feel-Bad Movie Of The Year!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks stupid.
-_DJEzZk2pc,He looks good as joker but the trailer isn‚Äôt pulling me in but I‚Äôll still go see it anyway
-_DJEzZk2pc,This Will be a good one Not like the last shitty one Jared
-_DJEzZk2pc,is this in the DCEU?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Incredible actor
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Holy shit, this will be epic. Joaquin went all in on this."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Just smile!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is what happens when you go full Joaquin Phoenix.
-_DJEzZk2pc,That smile doooo
-_DJEzZk2pc,There‚Äôs only ONE joker we all know who that is he owns that title !!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Im guessing by the time Batman comes around we'll be seeing a Joker with an oxygen tank stealing meds from the other residents of the home.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joker's crazy. So it would take a crazy actor, or one that's borderline to pull it off. Looks pretty good"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Should have been ""Willem Dafoe"" (the actor who played the green goblin)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Might be the first good movie DC makes.... but not gonna get my Hope's up.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I am so impressed and jealous of this part he got and apparently does right
-_DJEzZk2pc,They should‚Äôve kept the ages closer together and have made that kid a orphan or something like that so that Batman still can be a character or something like that
-_DJEzZk2pc,.....why did I think Joaquin Phoenix was dead?! This was unexpected...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Y‚Äôall saying it looks good. I am a huge fan of Ledger and I really wanted this guy to make it better but I really don‚Äôt see how...I might have to wait for the movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,A Gamer Riseing up
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks lame
-_DJEzZk2pc,This says a lot about our society.
-_DJEzZk2pc,You just feel bad for him...
-_DJEzZk2pc,It looks awesome.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I believe in this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I actually like the actor choice, u could never compete with heath ledger but it‚Äôs still good"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"He was made for this roll!!!! RIP River, thank God we still have you Joaquin!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,THIS LOOKS LIKE ABSOLUTE ART!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This LOOKS GOOD
-_DJEzZk2pc,üî• üî• üî• üî• üî• üî• üî• üî•
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can‚Äôt wait to see the Mr Freeze movie when he starts off as a misunderstood soda jerk.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why dies this look so mundane to me? it feels like the first ever attempt at the Joker. The mommy angle really?  As if we don't know what a good Joker is capable of.  I don't understand why he has to be so weak and pathetic looking. I shouldn't feel sorry for such an awesome villain. I'm sorry.... this .... wow...looks so insignificant and will be a no go for me. I was hoping for more.  Joaquin he is usually a bad ass. I am sure Joaquin will pull it off but the plot? Meh?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can see Joaquin Phoenix as the joker without a dought.
-_DJEzZk2pc,What a JOKE! Fucking trash!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Amazing
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is the most awaited movie for me since I really love to see what's the villains back story and i can really relate to it üòÖ
-_DJEzZk2pc,Meh im calling flop on this one tbh the top jokers will always be Jack Nicholson and ledger IMO but will see what happens with this one.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not really impressed by the trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,This made me smile
-_DJEzZk2pc,The perfect man for the job!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Finally someone so close to Heath Ledger

-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like trash to me
-_DJEzZk2pc,THE GOOSEBUMPS
-_DJEzZk2pc,Love the run
-_DJEzZk2pc,Been here since rumors about it
-_DJEzZk2pc,I will see this!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm on the fence with this. I'm not certain Phoenix has what it takes... Let's hope I'm wrong
-_DJEzZk2pc,How bad are movies getting?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I disagree with all these people saying that this movie looks good. to me it portrays to much good in the joker and to much backstory. I feel like it would have been better to show the joker in more of a heath ledger style because that was the best joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can't say it looks impressive.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Don't be mean to the next clown you meet.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope the movie is as good as the trailer.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Jauqin Phoenix as Joker. Wow. Good and terrifying.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is going to be horrible. Comic movies centralized around the Antihero never work. This is going to be one of those blow millions of dollars to try and make a unique take on the joker only to not make it up in ticket sales
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wasn‚Äôt expecting this from Joaquin, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll play this character amazing regardless"
-_DJEzZk2pc,God this is horrible
-_DJEzZk2pc,Batman struggles with this clown ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,lol why does he run like the joker from lego batman
-_DJEzZk2pc,life is a tragedy to those who feel and a comedy to those that think
-_DJEzZk2pc,Whats the name of the song?? Please
-_DJEzZk2pc,Holy shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,W fucking O fucking W
-_DJEzZk2pc,The origin is trash
-_DJEzZk2pc,Will never be better than Heath Ledger rip you will be missed
-_DJEzZk2pc,Meh.
-_DJEzZk2pc,part where they steal his sign hurt my heart lol
-_DJEzZk2pc,"the dc needs more independent films like this, instead of trying to copy marvel and create a whole universe where all the superheroes belong, create individual movies where its all about one character."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Can't comment on the movie (obviously),  but great trailer. Kudos."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Amazing!!! Joaqu√≠n Phoenix must win an Oscar!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,So now we're supposed to cheer for the psychopath? That's fucked
-_DJEzZk2pc,"When he stood¬† in front of the mirror in that orange suit it looked like a nice Heath Ledger tribute, even JP's hair and walk looks like him, JP rocks!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It looks interesting, but it seems the Joker keeps getting knocked around rather than hurting people like he does. Is that his gimmick this time? Keeps getting up?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why I am cryingggggggghhh
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can‚Äôt really say I‚Äôm that thrilled about this I love the joker. But I don‚Äôt see why dc feels the need to change so much with the Batman series. They see what ppl want but then they try to do something completely different. They need to stick to something marvel has a huge advantage in every way. If I didn‚Äôt grow up reading dc comics I would never give them a chance. I can‚Äôt even remember a dc movie other then dark knight that had me amazed or even leave an impression. Most of marvel movies are great which I love but I love dc as well from the comics that is and it‚Äôs sad to watch such a series be ruined. Dc has to step it up before a great series of hero‚Äôs become forgotten
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks shitty. Maybe I'm just like my father.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin is a fuckin legend.
-_DJEzZk2pc,So is this like the low budget joker that no one wants??
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I have watched this trailer 10 times at least, such an awesome trailer."
-_DJEzZk2pc,That looks fucking mental
-_DJEzZk2pc,I like the laugh
-_DJEzZk2pc,Mannnnnn!!!! He laughs terrifically like the animated joker....scary!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie is to hyped ..I have a feeling its gon b wack like less than everybody expects I hope I'm wrong
-_DJEzZk2pc,The only one that could save the DC universe it's the joker! Lol
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sorry. Looks awful.
-_DJEzZk2pc,An orange story.
-_DJEzZk2pc,beautiful
-_DJEzZk2pc,‚ô• ‚ô• ‚ô•
-_DJEzZk2pc,ohhhhh YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,and my personal opinion I don't know what to say I mean maybe for delusional weird strange people this movie maybe some kind of cult classic but I just wonder when are they going to realize the Joker is not a regular guy if you follow the comics at all you don't have to understand the Joker fights against Batman Batman fought against Superman The Joker Is Not a mere mortal he's really a bad motherfuker and until they put that on film DC's universe is going to continue to crumble they want to make it seem like oh he's a regular man and whatever the storyline is the Joker fights against Batman he's not a regular guy The Joker is a semi superhero he's not fully a superhero but he's definitely not a mortal man why can't somebody just do the movie according to the way the comics depict him people don't want to see regular people on screen they want to see semi Gods on Scream because that's what we like in the endgame look what you have superheroes people that can do things the mere mortals can't anyways figure it out or bring somebody in that can
-_DJEzZk2pc,I just don't see this being a good movie. I hope I'm proved wrong

 NO ONE CARES ABOUT THE JOKER!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel bad for him honestly he seems like he just wanted to be a good person originally but then he turned after his sad life
-_DJEzZk2pc,This mf‚Äôer went nuts doin this
-_DJEzZk2pc,I got low expectations for this one but we'll see. Still miss the Heath Ledger joker by far. RIP
-_DJEzZk2pc,He‚Äôs going to win an Oscar for this!
-_DJEzZk2pc,The Mayor of Crazy Town!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I got a bad feeling about this one
-_DJEzZk2pc,I just saw paperboy!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why have all these actors playing joker I liked the guy who played him in suicide squad wtf is this shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why does 1:29 always give me chills
-_DJEzZk2pc,I liked the Joker from suicide squad :<
-_DJEzZk2pc,That isn't the joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,okay this looks really good
-_DJEzZk2pc,You couldn't pay me in pornstar pussy to watch this goofy ass movie. Hollywood has straight-up ran out of ideas. God damn give it up
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks stupid
-_DJEzZk2pc,https://youtu.be/WzV6mXIOVl4 black widow made the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,this looks absolutely insane!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker is not supposed to have an origin story it's what makes him evil. With an origin story you have empathy but that's not what the joker is about. Joker represents the hypocrisy in society.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not at all interested or interesting.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie will break every box office record if its as good as the trailer.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Whattt another joker?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Johnny Cash lost his mind...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Says alot about society
-_DJEzZk2pc,another dark morbid sociopathic nightmare. put it in a garbage can
-_DJEzZk2pc,"the film itself may bomb, but Joaquin will still be amazing."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This looks quite interesting... Totaaly different take it Seems , Maybe Exploring what a mentally I'll deviant he becomes... I like it"
-_DJEzZk2pc,*BOOOOOOO*
-_DJEzZk2pc,What a marvelous trailer! But my question is.... where are the scars...?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker the antihero.....very nice.
-_DJEzZk2pc,You ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Some more shallow grub for the tasteless masses..
-_DJEzZk2pc,Awwwww he's trying so hard bless his little heart
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks seriously stupid
-_DJEzZk2pc,Might beat Heath Ledger's performance.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker's peefection : 3.0 owwwww!!!! Is it just me? Or is crazier out there?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why is this literally the dopest thing on planet earth
-_DJEzZk2pc,Holy shit did we just learn the jokers real identity before he became the joker üò±üò±
-_DJEzZk2pc,He looks like Phil Dunphy from Modern Family
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow this looks dumb as shit.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Vivimos...
-_DJEzZk2pc,SO MANY THINGS WRONG!!!üò´
-_DJEzZk2pc,Jared letto is better
-_DJEzZk2pc,This will be alot better than just another batman movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Isnt Joaquin the one who narrated earthlings?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think im going to love this movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The Joker is looking more like an anti-hero than the villain. I‚Äôm excited to see how it turns out. And everyone, remember to always SMILE!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"For some reason more than a spooky feeling, when i see how bad is the arthur's life, looking that he was a good man but the people just treart him so bad and anrthur trying to smile while he is crying makes me so fucking sad, i dont know, this will be a good movie but  it would be sad and dark"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow even I felt bad for him when they took the sign and cracked him with it
-_DJEzZk2pc,I longed for a Joker origin story for DECADES! NOW IT IS HERE!!!!! YESSSSS!
-_DJEzZk2pc,We gotta get him an Oscar
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks like the kind of movie that would make me want to cut myself.  Think I'll pass.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I FUCKING CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS MASTERPIECE !
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I always was a fan of him
This version is beautiful, so beautiful it hurts meüñ§"
-_DJEzZk2pc,It looks pretty bad
-_DJEzZk2pc,wheres the genecides in this video
-_DJEzZk2pc,They could not have picked a better actor for that role.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The note says ‚Äúthe worst part about having a mental illness, is people expects you to behave as if you    
düôÇnt‚Äù"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks trash
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where'sthe purple suit
-_DJEzZk2pc,It has to be a good movie plzzzzxz
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Idk why but this just doesn't sit with me, I dont feel like it'll do the Joker justice, I hope it proves me wrong"
-_DJEzZk2pc,All he is missing is what is called a Glasgow Smile.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Nope. This is 100 steps backwards from what has already been done in all forms of media. The Joker origin has changed a few times but the only one that was worse than this looks was the original Joker, a one time mass murderer that Batman kills at the end of the story. His story was just that he went crazy and would not stop killing until taken out...And Gotham already did the perfect Joker origin. 

This looks horrible and not made for fans...even Suicide Squads Joker was at least based off the New 52 Joker...this one is off on everything...seriously, how does he stay Batman's chief rival for decades if he is just becoming him in old age?!?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Awesome nice  graphics üòé haters will always criticize
-_DJEzZk2pc,Lex Luthor eisenberg would be a better joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,I like the joker but I doubt this will be that great
-_DJEzZk2pc,Every year same movie just diferent actor üò©
-_DJEzZk2pc,this looks so bad..... well done dc you have fuck another awesome character
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel like this movie is going to make the joker seem like a good person and the whole world hates him because of his positive attitude
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is going to blow dogs for a nickel and give 4 cents change. Ooooh, gritty reboot...oooh, we made the Joker evil...Give it a fucking rest already. Might as well give the Teletubbies a gritty reboot."
-_DJEzZk2pc,ü§Øü§°üíØ
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hereby move to officially replace Jared Leto.
-_DJEzZk2pc,You dumb F are really dumb aren't you? This is not the Joker you idiots!!! This is the JOKERS FATHER YOU DUMB FUAKS!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This better be good
-_DJEzZk2pc,I want the film showing arthur fleck get joker unpredictable abilities to trick law.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Off topic. (Huawei Ad) ""This is not a phone....."" Ofcourse It Isn't! It's a CCP spying device!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Im kinda dissapointed by the face paint
Its too sharp for the joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"FINALLY , they called their other movies dark but they were crap, FINALLY"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Another loser DC/Warners film? 

Somebody make it stop."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"1980s Joker: tripped and fell in a pool of chemicals
2019 Joker: Just throw him into society"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Oh God, no not again. A, superhero movie without the actual comic book character superhero. When Hollywood doesn't know anymore how to continue making movies about certain story / people etc. What do they do? Well you should know by now, they either make a remark, or.... A movie about before the character became lol! We go to the very first beginnings, when the character was still in his daddies balls üòÇ  Fcuk me this is such a shit movie, and adding to it some shitty indie feeling, epic fail. Same like the new batman movies, literally could be any movie as batman is absolutely useless, powerless, average."
-_DJEzZk2pc,HOLY CRAP BATMAN  JOKER HAS HIS OWN MOVIE ROBIN VOICE!!!!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,My favorite part is his laugh
-_DJEzZk2pc,The face paint is terrible it's ridiculous. The movie looks decent but I that face paint dear oh dear.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Superheroes will always have restraints placed on them as far as character development is concerned (they are ""heroes"" with a streak of goodness in them) , but villains have no such restraints. What makes a person, ""evil""? Ledger did a great job with the script he was given, but apparently, Joaquin's Joker will delve far more deeply into the pathos that helped create the Joker. And that makes for a far darker character, and a darker movie. But then, I think this was the only direction left in which to take for this character."
-_DJEzZk2pc,DAMNüò©üò≠
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hopefully it's better than the trailer makes it out to be
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel bad now for the joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks stupid
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:09 when your crush makes a cringy joke so you gotta laugh at it
-_DJEzZk2pc,I love Joker more than Batman... This movie finna be ass though
-_DJEzZk2pc,I got goosebumps I‚Äôm loving it... I hope it‚Äôs as good as the trailer üôèüèª

-_DJEzZk2pc,On October? Damnnnn
-_DJEzZk2pc,We live
-_DJEzZk2pc,A very interesting take on the joker. BUT DAMN I AM LOVING THE CLASSIC JOKER ATTIRE!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gamers...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Cn't wait.. hope this movie good like batman dark knight
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is gonna be insane origin movie. Heath did it perfectly, but this is going to be a legendary movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,Creepy dances. I like
-_DJEzZk2pc,I Think this movie is horror not an action Lol
-_DJEzZk2pc,"THIS IS OUR CHANCE, GAMERS"
-_DJEzZk2pc,sex is cool
-_DJEzZk2pc,Some people just want to Watch the world burn
-_DJEzZk2pc,wtf sick of seeing differant actors for the same character
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this movie part of DCEU?
-_DJEzZk2pc,i hope this shows a killer side of my pal the Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hell yeah
-_DJEzZk2pc,We may have found a worthy contender to ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,What about joker in Sucide squad
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope they include the chemicals in the factory
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is my favorite marvel character.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Best Joker Ever.....made üÉè
-_DJEzZk2pc,"At first I hated this idea, but the more I see about it, the more interested in it I am.

And you know what...that's EXACTLY the feeling I had about Heath Ledger when he was originally cast.  Admit it, you had that feeling to.  We all ate our words!

So pumped for October."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is so sad! He is just a poor man who wants to make people laugh and smile, but is constantly ridiculed for it. He also has mental health issues! Not that this justifies his crimes, but you get the point. :("
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oscar nom for sure.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Doesn't look good
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Damn, his such a badass when he comes around the corner! Feel like everything is gonna blow up behind him xD"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope it gets all the awards and money it deserves
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I dont know, seems like they made a completely different Joker storyline"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh this has so much potential.......please don't fuck it up guys.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks pretty stupid tbh
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I love Joaquin Phoenix, but this movie looks like garbage"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin might have been born for this role. Very talented actor
-_DJEzZk2pc,How I feel working in retail management for 15 years
-_DJEzZk2pc,"you all should be thanking Final fantisy seven  for makeing seproth ,   cus majority of villons have no up bringing to becomeing evil"
-_DJEzZk2pc,No one is ever going to top Heath Ledger's joker. I don't know why they continue to try.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Garbage
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I love the way he says "" What?"" ....."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Who thinks that William dafoe should be the joker?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Could be really good or really bad
-_DJEzZk2pc,That actor ...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"What the hell is that? I thought we will see a crazy ass mf joker like heath ledgers joker, and now this? Very dissapointing trailer"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"From all actor's right now, I Agree! As for DC, look 4 younger/adult ppl of today for next casts who are more lookalikes (R.I.P. the real Joker) if U want to win against MC & audience & so on! WHY SO SERIOUS! ;)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please blow up somthing
-_DJEzZk2pc,STOKT
-_DJEzZk2pc,Meh..
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin make‚Äôs the joker come to life with how he play‚Äôs him
-_DJEzZk2pc,Major fan of the Joker got to watch it
-_DJEzZk2pc,I didn't think we could beat Heath.....
-_DJEzZk2pc,What photography in this movie!! The depth of the expressions of Joaquin is so impressive! And the Song fits perfectly the development of the JOKER. The trailer alone is best than half a dozen hero movies!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Darker than the Knight :D
-_DJEzZk2pc,Er tut mir voll leid://
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks really bad. Hard pass.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is like a Deadpool without the blood xd
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally a decent movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,PLEASE BE AS GOOD AS IT LOOKS PLEASE!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Idk how I feel about this...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Im.... just not feeling it...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like Joaquin is back!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks absolutely terrible
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks shitty
-_DJEzZk2pc,Seems boring like family guy pass for me
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please don't be bad. Please don't be bad.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks retarded
-_DJEzZk2pc,I smell  Oswald cobblepot all over this film
-_DJEzZk2pc,I probably wont watch it. But I must admit it has potential. Either way this looks WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY better then suicide squads joker!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I never thought I'd be saying this but.....I'm hype to see Jokers dance moves
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dumb!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Society is the new villain :D
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can not believe river is playing the joker and not jack
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow this looks like a shitfest
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is there any connection to the recent DCU movie ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,All I see is Johnny cash AHHHHHH
-_DJEzZk2pc,Awesome!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Lyrics that remind me of this Joker:

üéµ'Cause the world has a way of tearing you down
Keeps you tied to the circus
Paints you up like a clownüéµ

--Misfits, Shinedown"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm a big fan of the Joker. He is probably my favorite villain from the DC AND Marvel comics. But I don't agree with having a backstory for him. No one should really know about his past. That's what makes him so mysteriously lovable. This movie looks great. I won't miss it for the world, but it may change the perception that some people (including me) have towards the Joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Im just saying my opinion Heath Ledger will always be the greatest joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow , I can't wait. He's nailed the joker !!  Only from darkness can the Joker's laughter  stem from.  When you spiral into madness and tragedy , when life chews you up and spits you out for no reason at all .......ITS FUCKING HILARIOUS HAHAHAHA"
-_DJEzZk2pc,looks good
-_DJEzZk2pc,GaMErS RIse uP
-_DJEzZk2pc,That kid he made smile has to be Bruce wayne

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Dude can‚Äôt handle life, blames others, starts doing bad stuff = joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Rise and grind gamers.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm sorry but this looks like shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm honestly not interested in seeing this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,"As iconic as Heaths Joker is, it's good to see an actor take the role and command it instead of trying to out do Ledger *cough Leto."
-_DJEzZk2pc,joaquin phoenix is actually crazy so it might not be bad.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath will always b the best jocker imo but this definitely looks decent guess we'll jus have to see
-_DJEzZk2pc,The simplicity of this movie will make it big.üëçüëπ
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is precisely how a trailer should be I've watched it 10x but still leaves me confused as  to how  the kind of movie it's going to be
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel like this is a stupid movie to be made. Watch a dozen mass shootings and killings occur because some fucked up freak was inspired by this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôm excited. Nothing will compare to heath but this will be good
-_DJEzZk2pc,looks sooooooo bad
-_DJEzZk2pc,If it's not rated R it's gonna be trash guaranteed
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hahahahahaha
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can‚Äôt fucking wait for this to come out I‚Äôve been waiting for the trailer!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Damn. We really do live in a society.
-_DJEzZk2pc,When i watch this trailer i get sad. He just loves his mother more than everything but i have the feeling that she‚Äòs getting taken away from him
-_DJEzZk2pc,"You gotta remember, this was a really dark time for crime. NO batman. All of these assaults on Joker were commonplace for Gotham at this time, maybe if there was a batman back then there would be no Joker?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fucking epic trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks soooo shitty!! üò™üò™üò™
-_DJEzZk2pc,Phoenix rising
-_DJEzZk2pc,All see is acting
-_DJEzZk2pc,The movie may be ok but that Trailor didn't sell a thing...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Thats why his a bad guy
-_DJEzZk2pc,It looks good but I feel a bit like I liked the one from suicide squad better
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sexually biased female dentist  have no idea how to wear makeup these days. Not even kids are-were safe.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Soon to be the most unwatchable movie of 2019.

-_DJEzZk2pc,Another movie nobody needs.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The joker That we need
-_DJEzZk2pc,Two words: Heath ledger.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now that one looked pretty good
-_DJEzZk2pc,Zazie Beets & Brian Tyree Henry repping from the Atlanta crew!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Jack Nicholson was amazing, Heath Ledger was even better...I think Joaquin Phoenix is a good choice but he has some BIG shoes to fill. Who is Jared Leto?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I would love to see this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is honestly one of the best trailers I've ever seen... CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THIS
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks dumb
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like everyone from that show from Atlanta is in this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This might actually be a good Joker. Leto's method acting of a giggly sexist boring Joker was terrible, but this looks genuinely interesting. Hell yeah, DC!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,So many of you are comparing it to Heath Ledger. Are you too uneducated to know the Jack Nicholson's performance as the Joker in Tim Burton's movie? He upstaged Batman completely.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Amazing tbh but there‚Äôs a part of me that doesn‚Äôt want the joker to ever have an ounce of back story
-_DJEzZk2pc,I cant stop watching this trailer. Its so beautiful.
-_DJEzZk2pc,this ain‚Äôt it
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin is such an interesting actor üé≠
-_DJEzZk2pc,He looks more like a clown than the Batman joker. Maybe this is the clown joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joakin A great performance! It looks so good That im afraid to go to the cinema!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I realized that joker was sorta crying at 1:22 that's pretty sad....Joker is finally gonna get full respect in this movie I think‚úäüèª
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can‚Äôt wait for it to come out!!!!yessss
-_DJEzZk2pc,He's pretty good but if Heath ledger were alive he'd get the role
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think he killed the Waynes at around 1:25 and cheers up Bruce Wayne afterwards :|
-_DJEzZk2pc,FINALLY!!!! A DC movie i want to watch.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Somebody go check on Phoenix now that this movie is done.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel like this movie will be a great one. He was great in walk the line and I feel this will be another great performance
-_DJEzZk2pc,Me in the morning! 1:11
-_DJEzZk2pc,JOKER=BOSS!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Its gonna be epic
-_DJEzZk2pc,Who else came here from ifunny
-_DJEzZk2pc,This smells like another DC suicide.....
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'M SO SHOOKED FOR THIS
-_DJEzZk2pc,I cant wait!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This dude goes all in when he works a picture so you know this is going to be legit.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I don't like the setting of this movie. Joker should represent the darkest and craziest side of human rather than some people failed him that drives him mad. In the comics, no one is sure the origin of joker or who is him. Joker typically made up his stories every time and every time is different. This is what makes this character appealing: pure evil and madness."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm so tired of comic book movies. I was looking forward to the Spawn one because it sounded like a subversion or change of the genre, but this one.. I'm looking forward to this one."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Who else cannot wait, and seconds will be hours?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Simply beautiful
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Great actor, but what is the point if it's not leading to confrontation to the Batman?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where are Joker‚Äôs scars? Is that not going to be apart of this
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Im hoping the best for this film im sick of watching marvel allready and just want dc to start making great movies ,they fucked up on suicide squad but aqua man was good hears hoping joker is great."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks amazing!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Lol has the exact same look as jake gyllenhall from night crawler  even wearing similar clothing style LMAO. Still excited to see this though.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Don‚Äôt disrespect Heath Ledger like this
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks fucking awful.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh padre ser√° buen√≠sima
-_DJEzZk2pc,We live in a society
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks dull, I prefer the last two jokers , this mv is dry"

Society"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I wish they would have put this much  passion  into Batman. Everyone who has played  the joker since Heath Ledger has  been unforgettable and amazing! I can‚Äôt wait to see this!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Enjoyed the trailer.  Look forward to seeing the movie.

From the looks of it, they based it partially on The Killing Joke, which featured one of the many origin stories Joker has told about himself."

-_DJEzZk2pc,Too many jokers. Another psycho main character. Next..
-_DJEzZk2pc,This shit look wack asf
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks like an interesting take on The Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Am I the only one in this comment thread that thinks this just looks awful?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hopefully he will perform almost as good as Heath Ledger this trailer is looking really promisingüôèüèº
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is gonna be garbage.

-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is essentially a Dark Night *prequel*, meaning it almost has to be good."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I just hope at the end of this movie the joker would fall into this green strange stuff to change into the semi-monster in order to release the second future joker movie , i hope Warner Bros will play it smart ."

-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally a movie for gamers.
-_DJEzZk2pc,We all have a kind of Joker in us
-_DJEzZk2pc,No just no
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker is red hood until he falls in acid and his name isn‚Äôt known either. Smh I don‚Äôt know how I feel about this. One of jokers best plot points is he‚Äôs almost completely unknown before he becomes the joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I AM GOING TO LOVE THIS MOVIE
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is epic!! Just when u thought there can not be a greater joker than heath ledger's character. Joaquin Phoenix proves everyone wrong.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""And the Academy Award for best male actor in a leading role goes to..."""
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Sometimes I feel the same way. Life at most time seems like a tragedy, but occasionally everything all of the suned seems like a comedy and I feel so calm and at peace. To bad those moments are fleeting and I dont know what I'll do if it became my constant state of mind."

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Deam! I have seen this trailer like 30 times and it still gives me chills, so hyped for this movie."

R.I.P!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,* smiles jokerly*
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not the best joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Teal and Orange... it's the only thing I don't like about this thing. But the story looks awesome!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dead ass this movie sounds so bad
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ohh ohhh my God really I like the acting I waiting for movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yea I'm borderline on this.  It's a matter of how much we see of the Joker and how much we see of the broken man before the he becomes the Joker.  This has feel of if paced right can be good but if drawn out it will suffer.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The music ?? Pls
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks so terrible...

Good job DC"
-_DJEzZk2pc,How about ‚ÄúSuicide Squad ‚Äú joker ? I think ...DC shouldn‚Äôt make a new joker in the same DC Universe
-_DJEzZk2pc,From the trailer itself I think Joaquin has nailed it. What exactly it is I don't really know.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Soooo they are gonna ditch the original story and make one up? Not suprised
-_DJEzZk2pc,Either you die a HERO or live long enough to become a villain

-_DJEzZk2pc,Trash af
-_DJEzZk2pc,"They're trying to make the Joker a sympathetic character. And he starts off just being a pathetic bum, and seemingly ends up just being a child molestor. This may actually be the worst incarnation of the Joker I have ever seen. Holy shit."

-_DJEzZk2pc,this movie gunna be shite
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Would‚Äôve liked to see Willem Dafoe as The Joker, but Joaquin is great too!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Everyone knows that this guy is not Heath Ledger and will never produce a performance of his calibre but fuck me this looks like a step up from Leto.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This doesn't even seem like anything out of DC Comics. Doesn't even sound like his true origin story. But I've gotta say, they couldn't have picked a better person for the role. People may even start comparing this to Ledger's performance of the character, although they look so vastly different."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I like this,he returns into a normal person instead of the kms squad one"

There was a time i was sprinting in my old apartment parking lot because i felt possessed by demons and i just screamed then laughed. I didnt see myself as a female joker, i saw myself as the devil. I'd be cutting myself and laughing at the same time. It's super crazy. Thank God I'm on good medication to calm down. I want to be a motivational speaker for the people who are troubled. Its UNBELIEVABLE that those evil things happened."

Something is in this clip for sure."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I was excited when I heard about this but seeing the real trailer it looks like it's gonna suck . BUT, its gotta be better than Leto , cuz  that shit was a disgrace"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Are they making him look like old school joker from the 60s? Cause thats the only justification i have to being this uncomfortable (that and im too young maybe).
-_DJEzZk2pc,I mean not to bitch but they couldn‚Äôt have done any better with the makeup ? The movie looks great and even his character as the joker is way better than I thought but the makeup looks corny.

-_DJEzZk2pc,Its interesting. Nothing like jokers actual origin but I like the idea. Joaquin is a good actor. It is hard to take it seriously though. Looks very low budget
-_DJEzZk2pc,Lady's and gentleman this is going to be the best DC movie ever...
-_DJEzZk2pc,The Joker shouldn't role in Justice League along with alien & monster from the sea. He's not CGI

-_DJEzZk2pc,I always asked myself why does the joker not have a movie and everyone said if the joker is the protagonist who is going to be the antagonist well humans themselves are the antagonists here.

-_DJEzZk2pc,"I am a fan of Jared Leto's joker so I really don't like this Joker. My favourite is Jack Nicholson and Jared Leto. I didn't like Health Ledger Joker either. My issue is, I feel like the Joker is suppose to make me laugh. And I don't like Jokers that are too serious. I feel Jared played the role perfectly between funny and psycho."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Criminals made Batman

Society gave us the Joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This trailer is a piece of art in itself. I keep watching it on repeat. Nat King Cole's Smile is the perfect song choice. This just might be the best trailer I've ever seen. At least can't remember anything that would top this one.

-_DJEzZk2pc,Suicide Squad was not A JOKER MOVIE. Letos version was a psychotic version that we as fans didnt fully see. Nobody could ever replicate what Heath did. Ever. So give other versions of the clown prince a try. You can't say Leto's was bad because you barely saw him.

-_DJEzZk2pc,"I just had an idea yesterday working all night listening to my i pod and these songs came on. Perfect for this movie. Animal, def leppard- for when he's performing in his early years. When he starts breaking down and losing hope play the forest by the cure.  Then when he completely loses it play run with me by the doors. Towards the end play, you only have one shot by suicide silence. This would be during the most violent of scenes, the climax.
The songs in that order would basically explain all the sequential emotions of the movie. If you know all of these songs and bands congratulations. More than likely you'd agree with me. Kind of something leaning to how great the crow with Brandon lee, that amazing soundtrack."

-_DJEzZk2pc,That was a lot to take in. First I felt happy that the trailer was released. Then I felt confusion and idk why. After that I felt fear because of the thought of a man mentally deteriorating. Then joy again because I love it already.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I really hope that this is good. I mean it looks like its gonna be awesome. But DC has a reputation of fucking up lol so hopefully they didn't with this one. I'm hoping that Joaquin Phoenix wouldn't sign on to something he wasn't sure was up to par.
-_DJEzZk2pc,song name ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm ready
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sucks
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like a comedy shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,I just got extremely excited...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks like a great movie, but would have been better if Heath Ledger was still alive to play the part. Nobody can top his performance in The Dark Knight movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm jared leto fan, but this is better"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Monsters aren't born, they are made."
-_DJEzZk2pc,We want bad jokerüëäüèæüëäüèæ
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sorry it is just a copy the original one is lost..
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don't get why everyone in the comments saying they think this movies gunna be good. I think it looks trash and so dose everyone else ived talked to about it
-_DJEzZk2pc,"In general, DC movies are garbage but this seems to have potential."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yes.
-_DJEzZk2pc,just NO...i dont want to see drama in DC
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can't say any words sir . I feel like Heath ledger is back joker is back....
-_DJEzZk2pc,Idk looks corney as fuk and when did joker ever talk bout his mom
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm so happy. Sorry Leto, this is how you do it. No Heath, we will never forget you. But we can see your spirit in this. This is what we've been waiting for everybody."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks absolutely fantastic. It helps to have an actor who can fully lose himself in the character and Mr. Phoenix knows how to do this with perfection.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Why are Villans getting backstory now? They are the bad guy, we don‚Äôt give a fuck about his mother. I don‚Äôt care why Thanos is a dic, I just want to see him lose...you people have got to get over this reboot shit and come up with ORIGINAL CHARACTERS"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Way better than Jared Letto, I think he could give Heath Ledger's joker performance some competition."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Yeah...I dont think it wise to put out a movie of sociopathic society...creating madness...creating despair...creating mad men who find solace, enjoyment, and humor in such an environment...given America's current state.  I would out this project back about 4 to 5 years...just saying"
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:51 Bruce Wayne?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is basically the 1966 joker and the dark knight joker mixed.
-_DJEzZk2pc,üòé
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joker before(thrown in chemicals) joker now(thrown in a society)








Really makes you think"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks very promising. Now I expect a masterpiece! :D
-_DJEzZk2pc,What type of bullshit is this
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this a joke?
-_DJEzZk2pc,damm this looks good
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yo that looks ill.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Woah...some of that was creepy and fucking awesome. I hated the pimp/ gangster/ baller Jared Leto did with his role on the joker. He was just terrible. I‚Äôm psyched for this movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,WauüòÆ
-_DJEzZk2pc,0:48 where is his left shoulder
-_DJEzZk2pc,Shouldve said I use to think that my life is a tragedy but now i realize its a joke
-_DJEzZk2pc,üëéüëéüëé
-_DJEzZk2pc,This trailer is amazing
-_DJEzZk2pc,"There are more dimensions to it than just this but, I can't help harkening back to Buffalo Bill in Silence of the Lambs for some of these scenes"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If the movie is half as good as the trailer, it will be a good movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,The Joker's mom name is Martha
-_DJEzZk2pc,"1:07 
Sheer Joker Perfection"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks good but I can't help but think how epic this woulda been with Heath.
-_DJEzZk2pc,He Looks good for this role. However NOBODY'S going to be able to top Heath Ledger fucking NOBODY. All of the different variants have brought good things to the joker character but Heath will always be THE BEST.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this the sequel to Her?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why do I get the feeling that this is a prank and no such movie is going to exist
-_DJEzZk2pc,Anybody but Leto please .
-_DJEzZk2pc,"What a surprise another Joker, guess they have run out of ideas"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This looks like a good DC movie, they are finally getting better at there movies"
-_DJEzZk2pc,this looks so bad...ledger is turning in his grave
-_DJEzZk2pc,More Hollywood pc bs!!!! I refuse to watch this movie!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Why do I find this hot, um"
-_DJEzZk2pc,batsy?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Damn looks good!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Der beste Joker ist und bleibt Heath Ledger. Ruhe in Frieden Heath üò¢üò¢
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not convinced. At least it's better than Jared Leto but that's not a difficult task to accomplish.
-_DJEzZk2pc,this better be good  i swear
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker is nothing whitout the batman üëéüëé
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Time to get that new batman story rolling. Stick with this dark route DC, don't fuck this up. I might forgive you for Ben Affleck."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I smell academy award,"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow this really shows that we live in a society
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ok, that was really good"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I didn't want a Joker origin movie, but really want to see this now!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Absolutely nothing against Joaquin Phoenix, but I just wish Heath Ledger was still around to create this masterpiece for us. :'("
-_DJEzZk2pc,But that's just me
-_DJEzZk2pc,I love Jimmy Durante but personally I would have done cuts from Shine On You Crazy Diamond by Pink Floyd
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin should've kept walking the line and left the Joker to a more fitting actor. He is good in other films, but this one, this one is not a part for him. William Defoe would've put on a better show. If you want to play the Joker, you gotta want to live it and BE the Joker! Jared Leto got more in tuned with the role. Jack Nicholson was the best EVER!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I haven‚Äôt been this exited for a movie in a long time. Not into the whole superohero stick that marvel goes for. DC is far darker. This has potential
-_DJEzZk2pc,All fun and game until Russel crow turns up...
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm more mad than that McDonald.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I wonder if they‚Äôll incorporate the Red Hood or if that‚Äôll ever be a thing
-_DJEzZk2pc,Worst joker ever  joaquim Phoenix is not making for that role
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm going to go see that film
-_DJEzZk2pc,everyone is gonna start liking the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Am I the only person who is less hyped about the movie after watching this?
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC is always better with the villains hmmm
-_DJEzZk2pc,I get a feeling this will be epic.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Maybe DC movies would be better if they didnt change actors every year
-_DJEzZk2pc,Cant tell if Joker origin story or a movie about a random lgbt member.
-_DJEzZk2pc,1st sneak peak Trailer Sucked. This Trailer actually makes me want to go see this movie.  Looks awesome.
-_DJEzZk2pc,ü§°ü§°ü§°
-_DJEzZk2pc,No one can be better than heath ledger‚ô•Ô∏è
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hmm.....You finally got me curious again DC. Bring it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"1:51 Bruce Wayne, maybe."
-_DJEzZk2pc,What about joker movie of william dafoe ???
-_DJEzZk2pc,Man needs to eat Jesus
-_DJEzZk2pc,No action in the bloody film?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"His performance is chilling. I'm not a fan of the makeup though, if his makeup is like this in any of the comics, could someone tell me which?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,The Joker smiles because Batman never does.
-_DJEzZk2pc,He looks like Jim Carrey
-_DJEzZk2pc,Johnny Cash snapped
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin did some great justice on his best friend's best role in the cinematic universe.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I wish theyd stop messing with classic stories.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Too bad this couldn‚Äôt have been heaths movie... :(
-_DJEzZk2pc,Just smile
-_DJEzZk2pc,"People need to realise, the Joker is the only sane one in Gotham. He knows he's in a comic series,that's why everything is hilarious to him. ""Is it just me or is it getting crazier out there?"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why does he look anerexic
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is like watching how I imagine myself ending up if I have to continue commuting into London for another 5 years
-_DJEzZk2pc,Haha ein mobbing opfer!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"when i saw this in my suggestions all i could think was wow...ANOTHER joker? but i watched the trailer, and this is one i might actually watch."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks like a bad April's fools joke.  I am not looking forward to this.  I didn't think we would have a joker worse than Jared Leto but here it is.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Suicide squad joker is waaay better
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like they've ruined another DC Character
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why not jared leto
-_DJEzZk2pc,i love jokerÔºÅwe love joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"He's a skinny legend üòÇüòÇ 
(Don't get me wrong, im a fan of joaquin Phoenix tho)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,The laugh is so creepy....
-_DJEzZk2pc,Damn they got paper boi in the movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,I just don't like his acting. Never have.. But let's hope it's a good movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Theres no better joker than heath ledger period
-_DJEzZk2pc,"sorry captain marvel and avengers Endgame, joker will take every Oscar's award"
-_DJEzZk2pc,paper boy is that yoooooouuuu.. from atl to gotham aaayyyeeee
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Okaaay,  am I the only who thinks a regular person with no skills besides being a clown gets so mad  and just out of the blue becomes a super villain isn‚Äôt a bit of a stretch?  Also, Shouldn‚Äôt the Joker be younger?  I am all for this kind of movies but C‚Äômon...."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Batman is fantasy but Joker is real
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm kind of uneasy about this. Generally, Joker origin stories are things that should never be told, because they don't matter to the Joker's character"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I don't know.  This trailer looks like a hot mess.  It's just stereotypical at this point.  ""The person who cares too much becomes the outcast, the outcast lashes out and becomes the villain, and the villain is hunted by authority and loved by the 'ever day folks.""  WIth some psychological 'twists' I'm sure.  Na, this plot is getting stale."
-_DJEzZk2pc,His Voice kinda reminds me Sean Penn in This Must be the Place
-_DJEzZk2pc,"really? dc cant get there shit together pick a timeline and a story and learn from MARVEL UNIVERSE ""Make your movies backup the fandom already. it does look really really good tho"
-_DJEzZk2pc,It looks like shit...
-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôm predicting there won‚Äôt be much action scenes in this movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,heath ledger already has competition...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Madness is just like gravity...all you need is a little push
-_DJEzZk2pc,People are finally seeing who the real hero is in Gotham
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is it just me or this is gonna be the darkest DC movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow! This is looking nice!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is gonna suck
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks horrible.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The restrained anger of jaoquin is terrifying...well done
-_DJEzZk2pc,ONE MOMENT FOR HETH LEDGER
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I love this already. Maybe DC should stick with the ""realistic"" more mature approach instead of the childish Marvel approach."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Oh.... I have never been so excited for a DC movie... I know nothing about the Joker, I know little to nothing about Batman.. But this.. this movie looks incredible. 


What's happening to me? Mother? Help me."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"As long as he is anything like The BATMAN ARKHAM Games Joker or The Dark Knight Joker, then I'm fine with that... Anything but that shitty Suicide Squad Joker ü§¢"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I usually hate Marvel or DC's movies. But for Phoenix's performance in this one, i will make another exception to watch it"
-_DJEzZk2pc,So if we're starting out with The Joker does that mean we can expect a Batman movie finally?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I saw the trailer 
I Liked 
I commented ""BETTER THAN OVERRATED JARED LETO""
Have a good day ü§òüèª"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Still Worse Than Heath Ledger, he was THE LAST JOKER."
-_DJEzZk2pc,100 p not going to watch
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The trailer looks amazing, hope the movie live up to it"
-_DJEzZk2pc,boring
-_DJEzZk2pc,This guy is so old

-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow maybe DC can make something decent with Christopher Nolan making it. Maybe
-_DJEzZk2pc,Bullshit make it real with the transfomation from Redhood to Joker and not this piece of shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôm confused does this take place in the DCEU?
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is gonna be good
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Acting great.
Typography üçë"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath ledgers joker is still the best üåö
-_DJEzZk2pc,This genuinely looks awful.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Heath Ledger's Joker had a solid backstory that was only implied - the character ran true to form, but the audience had to figure him out as he went along -- the reference to soldiers getting blown up without concern, the special-forces skills, the preference for demolition -- Ledger's joker was a disillusioned patriotic soldier with PTSD who saw the waste of politically-expedient war and became a deranged cynic, showing society the ugly truth about itself.  But we didn't get a movie to show us how that happened, we were presented with the character de novo, without explanation -- learning what the Joker was truly made of was part of the creepiness of the character: ""which way is he going to break?!  Aaaaaaa!"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,joaquin phoenix is perfect for the joker. Like heath
-_DJEzZk2pc,"What is with this whole ""the joker is wearing makeup"" bullshit? The jokers entire body was turned chalky white and his hair green because of falling into chemicals. Or is that too much white for the sjw snowflakes in Hollywood?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Me: (Screaming) Stop it! Stop it! Please I beg you! This is sick! It's a sin! It's a sin! It's a sin! It's a sin!

Producer of Joker movie: Sin? What's this talk about sin? 

Me: That! Using Chaplin like that - he did no harm to anyone! Charlie just wrote music and made people laugh!

Producer: Are you referring to the background score? 

Me: Yes!

Producer: You've heard of Chaplin before?

Me: Yes!

Producer: So you're keen on music than?

Me: Yes!

Producer: Can't be helped. Here's the punishment element perhaps. Make a note of it to the director if you please. I'm sorry viewer, this is for your own good.

Me: But it's not fair! It's not fair I should feel ill hearing Chaplin! Not Chaplin! Not Chaplin!

Producer: This is your only way out viewer. The choice is yours.

Me: You needn't to take it any further sir! I'm seeing the error of my ways! I'm seeing things that I've never seen before! I'm cured! Praise God!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin Phoenix acting in Gladiator was so intense / cruel / full of emotion, I bet he will own this character. Glad to finally see him back on the big screen, such raw talent."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"He reduced weight a lot, didn‚Äôt he?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Shits gonna be ass
-_DJEzZk2pc,Like like like! Thats how you do it DC! Im smiling alright....
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think The Jokers origin should remain a mystery. It's part of what makes him such an awesome villain.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Well, better be good and not disappoint us"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks good
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don‚Äôt think that he‚Äôs the bad guy maybe the world just failed him
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC is finally starting to make moves again üî•üî•üî•üî•
-_DJEzZk2pc,*No one can replace that legend You know who i am talkin about*
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Lets put a smile on that face , shall we? + RIP Heath ledger üòî"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""why so serious""

The joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Lighten up DC...
-_DJEzZk2pc,John Wanye Enterprises Gacy
-_DJEzZk2pc,Damnnnn
-_DJEzZk2pc,They should have chosen Michael Keaton to play the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I‚Äôm a die hard heath fan, and nothing will ever replace him, but this... this could stand up there with heath‚Äôs joker for sure"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Unpopular opinion: This movie looks really corny.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Jared leto is the best joker scene play
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC threw Jared off the cliff lmao
-_DJEzZk2pc,Jared leto left the movie industry
-_DJEzZk2pc,What the hell are DC thinking?
-_DJEzZk2pc,nope
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks completely shit in my opinion a disappointment to what the real joker is
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yeah more victimhood mentality propaganda films cool
-_DJEzZk2pc,I've seen better versions of Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Let's just ruin the fact the Joker doesn't have a true origin, come on that was the beauty of the character!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I never thought anyone would top Ledgers Joker, but it looks like Joaquin Phoenix might just do it."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Yeah just what I wanted a comics drama, good luck on making your investments back"
-_DJEzZk2pc,veteran actor.....great perfomance
-_DJEzZk2pc,I wanna cry watch thiss
-_DJEzZk2pc,It feels like...a musical...
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope Joaquin will be ok after this role! Good Jokers don`t last long!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Spoiler: The joker becomes bored with life, grows a beard and starts a rap career mid-film."
-_DJEzZk2pc,All it takes is one bad day..
-_DJEzZk2pc,Best joker I‚Äôve seen yetüî•
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now this is a gamer movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Just one thing to note, how does he go from a bottom of society street clown to a maniac criminal mastermind that put even Batman to the extreme ? Does he get a massive IQ boost after becoming crazy or somethin ?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Se ve genial
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks so good :)
-_DJEzZk2pc,The music gives me a serious burton vibe
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please need neam the song
-_DJEzZk2pc,Got to admit that this joker is better than suicide squad but he is not the best looking he don't look right or is it just me ?üÉè
-_DJEzZk2pc,I thought the poster was an April fools joke and now there is this!?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel kinda bad for this joker because the trailer shows him enjoying his life with his wife and with all of the people making fun of him and beating him up it just makes him to give up on everything and go do some crime
-_DJEzZk2pc,movie comes out on my birthday :)
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Thank God, proper joker.. I always hated heaths version, the lip clapping and lick drove me insane."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Am I the only one who thinks this looks trashy? Also not like the joker at all, the joker was funny and unscrupulously, and strong. This one is weird, seems to have the weirdest relationship to his mother and is weak. I could emphasize with the earlier versions more than him. And why tf do people beat him up simply because he wears a clown costume? Grown man in the subway with suits on, like they are going home from their office job or something see a clown and the only solution to that situation is to beat him?
I'm a big fan of DC and Marvel movies but I'm really not sure if I'm going to watch this one..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This shit looks good
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is more darker than my future
-_DJEzZk2pc,Health ledger is best in joker role
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin is the right Joker at the right time.
-_DJEzZk2pc,At least this one has a story behind it all instead of driving in a car with Harley quinn
-_DJEzZk2pc,This trailer is better than Suicide Squad
-_DJEzZk2pc,This trailer alone had me on the edge of my seat and kept my attention. I can't wait to see what the movie is going to do. GO JOAQUIN PHOENIX!!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,1.7K dislike from thanos fans
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm sick of shitty Joker movies just to make some money in movie theaters. Since Leadger Joker  industry is just forcing Joker and every time is more shitty
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""Somebody give that kid a burger"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh my fucking God. This Movie put my a smile on my  Face........hahahahahahahahahüòÜ
-_DJEzZk2pc,The creation and concept is BadAzz
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks pretty shite to me
-_DJEzZk2pc,wow looks much better than i expected it to be from the screen test.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Released the trailer a day before Ledgers birthday. That's the real madness.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This Joker really gives me that Animated Series Joker vibe. The laugh really sells it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hoffentlich ist der nicht so beschissen wie der letzte von ihmüôÑ
-_DJEzZk2pc,Are we finally gonna learn how the Joker got those scars?
-_DJEzZk2pc,üòÅ
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can't wait...
-_DJEzZk2pc,What on earth looks like they make joker get shitted on all the time
-_DJEzZk2pc,The best joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally someone like jack nickleson.looks good like dude said he looks like he has not eatin sence preduction haven't seen him weird like this sence gladiator üòâ
-_DJEzZk2pc,He kinda looks like Ronald McDonald in this adaptation
-_DJEzZk2pc,So the character who should not get an orange story gets an orange story?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Why do you have to put such a good actor to do this character?, we are supposed to hate the joker, now that i see this Joaquin Phoenix performance i kinda feel sorry about that guy, fuckkk!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:51 Bruce Wayne?
-_DJEzZk2pc,This actually looks pretty good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow there are no explosions in this trailer Says-A-Lot about what the movie would be like a lot of background story I'm waiting to see it
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Where is batman? ü§î





Stupid thanos"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks so shocking. The more times a new joker comes a long it just shows how good heath was
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I watched this trailer bcoz I thought Bruce Wayne (batman) will appear. No batman? üò£


Oh wait this movie don't need a super hero. It's about super villain."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This looks amazing. Hints of The Warriors, French Connection and a Dark Knight look this is exactly the direction DC should go."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Finally a fucking movie about an antagonist. 
And it‚Äôs looking great so far"
-_DJEzZk2pc,No one can beat old joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,When he‚Äôs dancing while going down the steps reminds me of the old jack Nicholson joker. Ugh I can‚Äôt wait! And then when he looks in the glass opening his arms reminds me of the Heath ledger joker. Ughhhhhh!!!!!! And then his suit reminds me of the Cesar Romero joker!!!!!!‚Äô Ahhhhhh. This is going to be good üôå
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is the joker going to tell ANY FUCKING JOKES THIS FUCKING TIME?!?!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Somethings wrong with Johnny Cash
-_DJEzZk2pc,We all know who the real joker is you should know his fucking name
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is that Bruce Wayne @1:52?
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks in the range of Heath... Creepy and Insane. Let's Go!!!! üíØüìΩÔ∏èüí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏üí∏
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is that Ty Burrel?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fuck this looks good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I mean it's no health ledger but it looks pretty damn good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,be careful or you will never get the skin of the demon off you
-_DJEzZk2pc,"How to get rid of depression!

-_DJEzZk2pc,I fucking love the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yeah.  I knew this was gonna be freaky.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The second good DC trailer after shazam
-_DJEzZk2pc,You know what pisses me off about movies today? The extraordinary lengths of the previews. 2 minutes is WAY too long bro. You‚Äôre basically showing me the whole fucking movie with plot points before it even gets released. Why? What happened to keeping the samples short and sweet to build suspense? ESPECIALLY a suspenseful plot such as the joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,ARTHUR WTF
-_DJEzZk2pc,"i needed a joker origin, will this be like the killing joke? all it takes is just one bad day"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The most dangerous creation of any society is the man who has nothing to lose. ""James Baldwin"

-_DJEzZk2pc,"I will go watch it because its batman related, but fuck u are fucking up bad DC"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joe rogan bio
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now. I already hate BATMAN
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can‚Äôt wait I‚Äôm either going to love it or hate it
-_DJEzZk2pc,this doesn't look as good as the previous one's
-_DJEzZk2pc,Damn... I got chills just looking at the trailer.
-_DJEzZk2pc,i still kinda prefer heath ledger though but this guys face just screams the joker and it's awsome
-_DJEzZk2pc,Let me find a comment and copy it for likes üëç
-_DJEzZk2pc,"No..just NO wtf DC  after a brilliant movie like dark night with Joker as an icon as a master tactician a ruthless militarized mad man, u dont follow up on that and instead u make this ?  Wtf is wrong with you it dont make sence"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Niceeeeee !!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Now we're talking , looking forward to this"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Runs fast as fuckkkkkkk
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The Joker is the most complex, difficult and risky character to perform. Only the best actors are able to pay the price for assuming this role."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Pogo's!   OMG!   Those who historically visited that ""night club"" wound up buried in the crawl space.  :)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Der Schauspieler passt nicht
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks like a terrible movie already
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks stupid..
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix sould have been the DCEU's joker the first place not Jared Leto
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Alrighty then! I'm gonna go shower now, and then go call my therapist, because I don't feel right after that! WTF? Of course, you don't get to be like that without a horrible back story!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,üòÇ.meht no hgual I tub dam ma I kniht elpoeP
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie doesnt even looks like there will be some joker doing crime.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Right now the studio is saying. ""Everyone seems to love this, let's change everything about it just to Fuck with them."""
-_DJEzZk2pc,the badass joker is better
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is what i love from DC, its darker theme than MC :)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joker you mean Health Ledger
Nobody is replace to him"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks terrible just saying
-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôm glad that the DC film franchise realized their mistakes with their first couple of movies and are fixing it. This looks like it will be an amazing film.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Damn this looks interesting honestly i hope its good
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie is going to be so fucking dark. I can't wait!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Look at this Clown Ass Nigga
-_DJEzZk2pc,It looks boring and kinda dumb not excited at all.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I like what I see
-_DJEzZk2pc,*Joaquin Phoenix doesn't even need make up to play the joker*
-_DJEzZk2pc,a trailer that doesn't give anything away! woo hoo finally!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow. just wow
-_DJEzZk2pc,The dedication Joaquin puts into the role is just astonishing
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Falling down meets DC, Very very cool."
-_DJEzZk2pc,They have changed the joker so many times to try and improve.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Good
-_DJEzZk2pc,Tsaki
-_DJEzZk2pc,I dont like this joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"THIS FALL: Joaquin Phoenix walks, runs, falls"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin Phoenix is a seasoned, critically-acclaimed, award-winning actor with decades of experience. As much as Heath Ledger is the current, well-loved joker who opened our eyes to what a Joker can be and should be, I believe Joaquin will take this is to a higher/deeper level. His micro-expressions, walk, speech, and all other movements are the embodiment of a human being who tried to do good but was beaten down, pushed to the edge that led to total psychosis."
-_DJEzZk2pc,What if this joker is the father of the Joker from Darknight ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Retarded...whatever you sheep will watch it anyway
-_DJEzZk2pc,The music makes it 10x better
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think the guy from suicide squad is better
-_DJEzZk2pc,They should of got someone else to do the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Stop the press, who‚Äôs that?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Madness is like gravity, all it takes is just a little push"
-_DJEzZk2pc,0:16 is that Dana White  voice?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Lame
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I hope the film has a similar soundtrack to the advert! Such a melancholic tone for a villain, I think it could be very unique."
-_DJEzZk2pc,So no Batman?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Society makes you crazy?
Well, at least it's still better than made you die in Alaska, ... Alone in the bus."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I have paper tommorow but I can't study because of this trailer, there's a lot of things going in my mind but nothing going into.üòä"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I just hope Batman makes an entry into this film as a surprise. (and by Batman , I mean Christian Bale)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"reallyyy?!?, worst joker yet!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If there's one man to equal if not better the Ledger, it's the Phoenix"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Never had an interest in a batman or joker movie until now.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like shit!! Bad choice for joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,take my money
-_DJEzZk2pc,Was that Bruce Wayne behind the fence at 1:51?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Thank God a movie i might wanna watch. Disneys done killed my childhood
-_DJEzZk2pc,Big shoes to fill... some people here know exactly what I mean.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"He is going to fucking crush this roll, cant wait."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I was expecting them to fuck this up but this looks absolutely fantastic
-_DJEzZk2pc,Master piece..
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Brie Larson: I don't need a white man to..
Joaquin: Sit down & smile little girl."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This actually... Looks pretty damn good
-_DJEzZk2pc,Whats the point wtaching this movie?
-_DJEzZk2pc,aight im hyped.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why you force me to like joker? If I become one you will blame me
-_DJEzZk2pc,sadly noone can beat jared leto's joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,üòÅüòÄüòÇü§£ just smile
-_DJEzZk2pc,"There has to be a part 2 ,fighting the Batman"
-_DJEzZk2pc,The potential is real *_*
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie is gonna be terrible. That is not at all what happened to him to make him joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Trailer is üî•
-_DJEzZk2pc,We really do live in a society
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Bad Lieutenant.
Falling down.
Taxi driver.
The Joker....
.... Borderlines."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Speechless.  Joaquin Phoenix great choice, and looks Oscar worthy....but I'm scratching my head on the origin story.  Guess we've seen so many."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I like the Joker character but I am not feeling much interest in this movie. Joaquin is an ok actor but  just doesn't feel right for the part in my eyes. Truth is it looks boring as hell. I don't see  many sitting for hour or more just to watch poor Jack (or whatever they will call him in this one) gets beat on by an evil world. And of course I'm guessing Jacks mom dies some tragic death which will push poor Jack - The Joker, over the edge.   I did like how Heath Ledger played him, I would have liked to see him    in this coming movie.     Time will tell I guess"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Lets put a smile on that face üòäüòäüòä
-_DJEzZk2pc,be honest this looks like a 66% rt score at best.... at best. If this is the teaser were in trouble. This looks like üêï üí©
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel bad for him he tried really hard to be happy
-_DJEzZk2pc,i think this will be a good movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath ledger reborn....
-_DJEzZk2pc,Doesn't strike me as the type of guy that can take on the likes of Batman. He should have been showing extraordinary genius and cunning from a very young age.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Smile..
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks stupid.
-_DJEzZk2pc,El guazon'''
-_DJEzZk2pc,nobody beats Heath Ledger in being the Joker....
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Lmaoaaoaoaoalolol at 0:30
Gay ass. Lolol. This aint the joker. Foh"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Bruh I bet his mother ain‚Äôt proud
-_DJEzZk2pc,"That's not Joker's backstory
........you can't just make up shit Hollywood."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where is capital?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Terrible...
Russo bros would never."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Not your fault joker
Nothing make sense in this world 
Do right world will kill you 
Do wrong world will be after you 
But seriously have a good smile"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is lit bruh
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""The worst part about having a mental illness is that people expect you to behave as if you don't.""
As someone with ADHD, I can sadly confirm this."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I got drunk at a birthday party
-_DJEzZk2pc,Would you like to know how I got this scar?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Not many details yet about plot. From what I've seen, this is a hard pass for me for now. Maybe it's the trailer but it just misses the mark, imo"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm smelling Oscar for Joaquin. And no one will be laughing.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The laugh at 1:08 gave me chills
-_DJEzZk2pc,We all love a good anti-hero
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is going to be insane!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Awsmeeeeeeeü§£ü§£ü§£‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è
-_DJEzZk2pc,Movie looks like shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow I'm blown away, amazing!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This look fucking amazing
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Maybe, this could be the worst Joker ever..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Just give him the Oscar please ‚ò∫Ô∏è
-_DJEzZk2pc,üëé
-_DJEzZk2pc,"People,people.Be calm.It's just a movie.Another masterpiece by Joaquin I hope.The fact that he's not the full quid is a huge help.
Heath now Joaquin.Brilliant."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Finally, decent acting"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It's cool to make a joker movie, only one problem.  WHY OCTOBER, ITS NOT GONNA BE OUT ON THE MONTH WHERE HALLOWEEN IS
 CHANGE IT LIKE ENDGAME, MAY TO APRIL"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'M SOOOOOOOOOOO READY FOR THIS, OMG WOW. THIS LOOKS ABSOLUTELY AMAZINGGGGGG!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This performance might be up there with Heath Ledgers performance! I‚Äôm excited for this new joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Well this looks dark af!

Not what I was expecting..

A totally different Joker origin story, but acceptable in a multiverse scenario.

I think this would have worked better without having to link it to the Batman mythology..

Just a film about a trodden down clown in a harsh world.

But, if you don't fully believe in your product it's always best to attach it to a much more established brand..

Still looks like a strong film tho,
I'll be checking it out fo sho"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"What if in this one he kills Bruce as a kid...

But I love the fact him going in asylum and seeing his parents on the news smoked."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hell if this joker at least grazes the status of Heath Ledger then we might actually have a good Joker int this movie(though that might not be the case)
-_DJEzZk2pc,society.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Was it a dislocated arm?!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks properly dark. Very excited to see this!
-_DJEzZk2pc,What the hell with his arm in 0:46?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Perfect... Warner kills the joker, the best villain of all time.... FU..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Imagine if the country just stopped caring and did what it wanted.... imagine millions of people who don‚Äôt have to hide their crazy just running around doing what they want for weeks. It would be glorious!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Your jokeing
-_DJEzZk2pc,"there's a lot of commitment poured in by Phoenix, i believe this movie's gon' hit hard"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This just looks sad and creepy.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Let's go.  Finally D.C
-_DJEzZk2pc,Super
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I would definately watch this.. on netflix.. Its not that its bad, but.. Why go to the cinema for it would much rather watch it at home. Maybe I'm just old and hate being around people."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think this could be another great film of DC after Aquaman and Shazam
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ive watched this like 5 times
-_DJEzZk2pc,"a true anti-hero holds up a mirror to society, looks a great performance from Joaquin Phoenix"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Seems to be a super good movie. I'm going to watch it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Only to find out at the end that he's just telling a story to some hostage. Joker's origin is supposed to be a secret, right? This trailer impresses, though."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If only it was heath ledger 
rip"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I am the villain of my life üòàüòà
-_DJEzZk2pc,"A lot of Atlanta characters... alright 

(Granted we only see 2)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Think i just  found my other favorite joker besides heath
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix     my godddddddd
-_DJEzZk2pc,He look better than jared
-_DJEzZk2pc,https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=158324025177367&id=100029993120261 üí£üé∂
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is going to be good
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Cat wait for this, no special effects just pure acting, bravo Joaquin, glad u got this role"
-_DJEzZk2pc,werent those the same steps used in the Exorcist
-_DJEzZk2pc,"DC: What do you think fans would want?

Fans: Stop trying to make new Jokers

DC: Man i really wish they would tell us. Maybe we should make another Joker?

Fans: Please just do something true to your comics

DC: This would be a lot easier if we had some sort of context to these characters. Should we maybe read one of these comics? Nah, lets just wing it

Fans: For the love of god just stop

DC: Hey you guys ever heard of that show Gotham? Me neither

Fans: This is why Marvel is winning"
-_DJEzZk2pc,0:28 this is the part where everyone regrets joker was a villian
-_DJEzZk2pc,is thia gonna be people just shitting on him or is he gonna turn tough like heath ledger when he was in prison. he kicked a cops ass got beaten up by batman and still managed to escape to shoot rockets at batman on a train. i hope Joaquin stops taking shit and kicks some ass
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Okay, this is a trailer. Basically a commercial. So why do we have to sit through a commercial to watch a commercial?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think that he look like the joker more than the other who played the role
-_DJEzZk2pc,"An interesting take on the Joker, not many people go near the origin story. Nice to see DC making more thought provoking movies rather than that whole ""Your Mom has the same name as my Mom. Now we can be friends"" thing."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger will always be the best joker but competition is usually healthy.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dc ruins the most iconic villain such a disappointment
-_DJEzZk2pc,"No one is a born monster, world makes monsters and sometimes it needs monsters to keep a check on the world."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Yeah, no thanks."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Makeup could of been better
-_DJEzZk2pc,This proves that no one is a villain by choice it's the situations that make them that way
-_DJEzZk2pc,I really hope he ends up putting on the iconic make up.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Still not Heath ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,Jared Leto was better... But this looks pretty good too.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""Is it just me...or is it getting crazier out there?""

No dude, it's just you."
-_DJEzZk2pc,2:16 OK . it gives me the shivers to think of it
-_DJEzZk2pc,Already more screen time than the one in Suicide Squad
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Shazam and Joker look epic! Looking back on DC's past failures, I think they're starting to make a comeback."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Lame
-_DJEzZk2pc,He is really good......but man I miss ledger.......üíîüíî
-_DJEzZk2pc,I cummed
-_DJEzZk2pc,Phoenix is good but Heath Ledger is a legend.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Watching this actually makes me feel worse for The Joker than Batman for dealing with him. I know what being bullied is like, but to have your dreams crushed entirely by a few thugs? Poor Arthur, I don't blame him for being so insane."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I have been saying this for last few years . And I will say even now Joaquin Phoenix is the greatest actor of all time for me . ""The Master"", ""you were never really here"" and now this.  Time and time this guy is giving us masterclass performances. He is better than DDL even."
-_DJEzZk2pc,While better than jered leto...it looks horrible. Im done with superhero movies im done with star wars movies and im definently do with horrible sequals to awesome 90s movies. Its no wonder big time actors are making the jump to netflix!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dream11 predication to my channel 100% winning
-_DJEzZk2pc,"By God, I think DC's starting to figure out how to make movies."
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC gettin realy good
-_DJEzZk2pc,"‚ÄúSure this looks good, but will it be as good as suicide squad‚Äù-said no one ever"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Um so did jared leto just cease to exist or is this his dad or something?  Suicide Squad movie is still part of the DC universe, right?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think that at the end joker gonna die
-_DJEzZk2pc,"well this is gonna be a masterpiece that touch our life and have a deep meaning 
unlike that BS we see in avengers"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Using 100 different actors as the joker is getting kinda crazy - but maybe thats the point!
-_DJEzZk2pc,100% relate
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I am actually mad. There's not red hood in the trailer,guess it's not going to be like the comics."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I wonder if a new Batman is gonna have a cameo in this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Batman: im Batman and I‚Äôm allways be the number one
Joker: hold my beer"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I always understood that he was always a bad guy, one of few who wasn't a tragic back story character,  but we now live in an age where there has to be a reason for the bad guy. That was what was so scary about the Joker to me though... there is no reason just straight crazy."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I am crying right now...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Movie looks dumb and his joker looks gay
-_DJEzZk2pc,This may be one of the best trailers for a comic book movie ever! Love the choice of music! Makes me want to see the movie now! I honestly can‚Äôt wait! Joaquin Phoenix won‚Äôt let me down!
-_DJEzZk2pc,His poor spine.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This film will tell us what makes a usual man so crazy.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I understand now why Batman does not want to kill him or him being dead. Because he knows the Joker really is... I feel bad for him and  I think this movie will be AWESOME
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So this is just like venom, about the bad guy but with no good guy."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Nobody comes even close to Heath Ledger,
Is there batman also in this movie ?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This hype for this movie just escalated to its highest levels!! The expectations will be demanding....I wonder if it can live up to the hype.....I hope so....the potential for Joker is unparalleled in the comic book universe...no CGI....no massive battles.....just a man battling against himself to maintain his own sanity in a mad & unforgiving world.....I think we can all relate to this story in one way or another....
-_DJEzZk2pc,I need to see this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This inspires me to wear a suit..
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not really a fan of the trailer in my opinion
-_DJEzZk2pc,A NEW FAN HERE
-_DJEzZk2pc,I loveeeee it!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks bad ass. I love Joaquin Phoenix
-_DJEzZk2pc,That's a very freaky laugh... I LOVE IT!!! I hope this version will be like Mark Hamill's. Funny yet really scary.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'd rather Heath ledger, but I'll give it a shot"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm having Jack Nicholson vibes from this
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Not my Joker.

But il watch itüòí takes balls to be the joker after darknight"
-_DJEzZk2pc,our life is a joke
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fuck this movie!!!! We want the Snyder cut!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,People already saying he‚Äòs on the same level as ledger wait till the movies out its probably gonna be garbage .
-_DJEzZk2pc,Boring
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Glad to have watched this recommended trailer! Now it‚Äôs time to share this with family and friends, hope it‚Äôs gonna be as good as it looks!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I remember being a kid watching him in Gladiator and he creeped me out so bad. It was my dad‚Äôs favorite movie and it negatively affected me. So I have always associated him as creeping me out. This trailer just creeps me out because of him.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The clown
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""Societies to blame!""
""Right! Arrest society!"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,Cast jim carrey as joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,What is this shit? This movie gonna be one of the biggest shit movie ever...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The most awaited joker origin story. And after Heath Ledger we thought ""whose gonna fill his shoes"" ? And if this movie is what it supposed to be in the trailer, It gonna make 'The Dark Knight' look a little gaudy. imho."
-_DJEzZk2pc,this will be epic. to me this is the true comic book joker. i cant wait to see this
-_DJEzZk2pc,Never thought i would sympathize for joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I going into this thinking it's the killing joke lol.
But then I see little Bruce 0,0 maybe this is the very first joker?
Then there are others who takes this guys place?? Idk haha"
-_DJEzZk2pc,already better than jared leto
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The guy's born to be the Joker.  DC is starting to really outshine Marvel with the movies and I'm tired of the loud, saturated bullshit the Avenger has become"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gotham lives in a society
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Let me get this straight. This guy becomes the Joker because a bunch of kids beat him up and some random bullys in suit smack him in a lousy train. Pretty deep story tbt (U.u)
For DC sake, I hope that's not the triggering reason..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is that boy bruce wayne?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Didn't think we could get any worse then that hack performance from ledger as Joker. Boy was I wrong. This looks absolutely appalling. Terrible in every sense. I at least hope the story is good because that Joker looks terrible and Joaquin is a horrible actor.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Damn I miss Heath Ledger, he was the perfect Joker..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Never knew that Joker is a doomer.
-_DJEzZk2pc,So fcking creepy and sadly
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not gonna lie I'm hyped
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This not joker, this is psiko's movie. Only psiko will watch that"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Do you realize how relatable this will be?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Never thought I would cry to a Joker movie trailer.
-_DJEzZk2pc,GARBAGE movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,"DC not every character needs a movie. The mystery of the joker and what made him, be it Batman, society or whatever is part of his character I feel. He just is, no explanation needed."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I still prefer Jared Leto though.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Completely psychopathic, worried for psychopath viewers could take advantage of this movie..get motivated to go crazy as joker shown here...."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Shit!  I have to wait till October to see this.

I want to see this movie now!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,He has an interesting body
-_DJEzZk2pc,I get goosebumps everytime I watch this trailer!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"You know why I hate trailers 




It's when they show the date"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hate this jokerüëéüëé I'll think Mr. Ledger is better than this assholeüòâThe best joker of all timeüòÇ
-_DJEzZk2pc,his laugh is what i hear when i see it in the comics so iconic already
-_DJEzZk2pc,This joker is cliche I don‚Äôt like it
-_DJEzZk2pc,the people who made this trailer did a damn fine job
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Dam that looks good, gave me a chill watching it."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Its awesome!! Great job
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If they do this right, this could be insanely good.


Pun intended."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This just looks sad and depressing - the best part about the joker is that he didn't care about his own back story, that's why he frequently lied and changed it to suit the moment. He was an enigma of a character and this will just unravel him and destroy the character for ever."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Shit looks stupid af
-_DJEzZk2pc,When he laughed for the first time I got goosebumps! This movie had to be good!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow!
-_DJEzZk2pc,First smile - and I already know this movie will be awesome
-_DJEzZk2pc,Interesting
-_DJEzZk2pc,Poor Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can‚Äôt Wait.    ü§óü§óü§óü§óü§óü§ó
-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôve never felt so sad & scared for a trailer üôåüèº go DC
-_DJEzZk2pc,Man I hate to be negative but it looks like DC fucked up again I was really looking forward to this too
-_DJEzZk2pc,is it too soon for us to announce that ledger's legacy is not in vain ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,This joke man this much bad üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèª
-_DJEzZk2pc,He looks like trevor in gta v
-_DJEzZk2pc,Am I the only one who's a little disappointed with this jocker
-_DJEzZk2pc,dc hits the nail on this one. this us definitely deserves an oscar
-_DJEzZk2pc,Victor Hugo has a small book with a similar character and story except the crazy part.
-_DJEzZk2pc,plz.... make it stop. This is going to flopso fkn hard sry not sry smfh
-_DJEzZk2pc,Phoenix is a great actor but I think the film is going to be an underwhelming pile of shit. * *LAUGHTER* *
-_DJEzZk2pc,Damn watching  trailer again.
-_DJEzZk2pc,What happened to jarred leto bruh?üòØ
-_DJEzZk2pc,Love the tribute to chaplin
-_DJEzZk2pc,My god this is so stupid
-_DJEzZk2pc,This don‚Äôt make me want to see the movie based on everything known about the joker maybe it‚Äôs just me.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Don't compare it with Marvel. 
It is just a good film on an interesting character"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Great aproach to the fact that he is a creation of the evilness of mankind. Perfect music it's like the music is his director.
-_DJEzZk2pc,We really live in a society
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker Bra im Kino
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:08
-_DJEzZk2pc,At least it‚Äôs not Jared
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It‚Äôs peaked my interest, but I‚Äôm not holding my breath."
-_DJEzZk2pc,The lesson of this movie. Love yourself first before others.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This will be really dark, and I‚Äôm afraid of connecting with it"
-_DJEzZk2pc,So basically we're gunna see joker get his ass beat by criminals until he snaps and becomes a criminal.
-_DJEzZk2pc,And then...he fell in some chemicals and shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,'fuck is this shit ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,This has to be good. Phoenix is crazier than shit in real life anyway.  This will be a Blockbuster.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I cant stop watching this trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,GoosebumpsüòÇüòÇ
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Interesting. Although I believe not knowing the origins of the Joker is one of his best traits in DC's comic books I do believe that if it's well made it could work wonders in a movie. Especially by the fact that a movie can be way more relatable than a comic book, making the audience more emotionally invested.


Joaquin Phoenix looks great. He has the eyes and expression of someone who suffers a lot but tries to keep going until he reaches his breaking point."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Spoiler. The little kid he puts a smile on is Bruce Wayne. :D
-_DJEzZk2pc,Alternate title: The Pompatus of Love
-_DJEzZk2pc,‚ù§‚ù§love the grabbing hold of my heart music.. And wow it's seems to be a great movie and l will watch it with no doubts.. thank you for sharing.. Hugs‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

-_DJEzZk2pc,Not again
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,this is just sad
-_DJEzZk2pc,That small kid at 1:51 is bruce Wayne ‚úåÔ∏è
-_DJEzZk2pc,Should get shia le beuof to do a joker movie as well just for shits and gigs
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is nobody gonna talk about how creepy his laugh is?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this like the actual story of Joker? Or just the story of this Joker? Sorry I dont really know much about Jokers story
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks terrible. Makes me laugh (pun intended) how people are saying this is really going to be good. That's not the Joker. This will be a fuck that up just like Star Wars got fucked up.
-_DJEzZk2pc,*WE NEED BATMAN*
-_DJEzZk2pc,Noooooo! It should be Jared Leto
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think Dc has the most interesting characters (Batman and The Joker). Just a opinion people.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Holy shit that actually looks decent
-_DJEzZk2pc,Your all a bunch of fucken sheep ! 9/11 WAS AN INSIDE JOB BITCH !
-_DJEzZk2pc,If only heath ledger was about to be the joker in this
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dont watch thisü§£-https://youtu.be/5Vm0QBiHMuA
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Just when I thought Heath Ledger+Nolan combo pedestal was untouchable, here comes Joaquin Phoenix. Brilliant trailer."
-_DJEzZk2pc,thank fuck  that edgy sparkle queen from Suicide is gone
-_DJEzZk2pc,Doing inhumane things when nobody is morally conscious about their life existence and food discrimination disorders
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nope not it at all
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks really bad. I love Joaquin and I‚Äôll still watch it but WOW it really looks bad
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks AND sounds amazing!
-_DJEzZk2pc,We want ledger back nobody can compare this looks goofy as fuck
-_DJEzZk2pc,If your a huge Gotham fan like me your gonna hope that they call him Jerome valeska
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Such a weak trailer . Movie seems so boring,I do like the message behind it though."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I wish DC Comics or Warner Brothers would talk to some fans before they start making crappy movies back-to-back. Marvel Comics is so far ahead on movies it is ridiculous. I have been a big fan of Superman since 1981 and the last two Superman movies I almost walked out of. Please get Kevin Smith back and have him write the script of a lifetime
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I hope we get to see him brutally murdering the people that stole is sign.
Edit: The colourgrading is insanely beautiful"
-_DJEzZk2pc,imagine if this is a story on the origin of heath ledger's joker! i would legit have my mind out open in a pasture and blow it up.
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC please just stop or start over no disrespect but please you can do better
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I feel so bad for the profession of a clown out there..) sorry guys, but this is some great acting, seriously"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Batman 1998: falls in pool of acid.
TDK 2008: small hints that he was once a soldier with PTS which drove him insane.

-_DJEzZk2pc,"That laugh @ 1:08 just gave me goosebumps ..
This is gonna be insane"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joker Is Just Not A SuperVillain..
He Just Had Some Problems..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,A good person turn into evil?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wasn't very impressed with the trailer. But going to watch it anyway
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think that young Kevin spacey would be perfect for the role.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dark deep down....
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Can't wait to watch this movie, This new joker movie looks promising!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,No one dies?!
-_DJEzZk2pc,The scene where he is coming up from out of the bushes is eerie as hell.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"he is definitly much better than jared leto but not even nearly as good as Heath ledger... ofcourse not, Ledger was a genius! so i'll see that movie i guess so i can watch another good actor playing as Joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"What's this, a fresh take on the super-hero-blockbuster trend?
Seems like they convinced the studios to finally ease up and let the director do his thing.
Excited!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,What song is the end?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Can we establish that Joker is still a villain? This movie looks great and all but I'm not looking forward to the rush of people identifying and worshiping the Joker. This dude has filled graveyards, tortured kids, and paralyzed Batgirl. So yeah, still a villain but he is hella interesting to look at."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why dc mocking heath ledger with this kind of silly make upsüò™
-_DJEzZk2pc,Anyone notice when he is in the elevator with the dude shaking on the gurney... Jokers hands are clinched like he is about to snap
-_DJEzZk2pc,Good idea. Bad way to do it
-_DJEzZk2pc,He has the joker laugh down
-_DJEzZk2pc,IDK about this movie.-.
-_DJEzZk2pc,*intrigue intensifies*
-_DJEzZk2pc,"That trailer changed my mind, maybe it's been long enough after alll."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now DC need bring Christian Bale to be Batman again and put these two on a movie together.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why...
-_DJEzZk2pc,No one will never be like Heath ledger.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ooh So this is showing his life before the batman films and what made him the joker then
-_DJEzZk2pc,The Oscar's piling up....right there.....
-_DJEzZk2pc,Damn the music
-_DJEzZk2pc,Edgar will ALWAYS be the best Joker ever
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The Joker once said, ""all it takes is one bad day."" But going by this trailer, he probably had several."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wooooow
-_DJEzZk2pc,Meh...
-_DJEzZk2pc,...so tragic. A movie to justify bad people doing bad things. üòÑ
-_DJEzZk2pc,Clicks on the joker trailer only to get the joker trailer as an ad
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC will be the first company that actually dares to make a memorable comic movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope they continue to use Phoenix for the Joker. Amazing! He has the right facial structure for The Joker and plays the part brilliantly from what is seen here.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I've watched this for the hundredth time yet it still amazes me. I'm so excited for Joaquin Phoenix's take on the Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sooooo...more comic books turned into the further degradation of societal standards by jewlywood's grasp of filth for the world.  Got it.  Thanks.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow very powerful emotions young Jedi
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is harley quin gonna be in the movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath who?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"As a child I used to think Batman was the hero and Joker the Villain. As an Adult, I now realized the Joker was the actual Hero."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm not into capeshit, but this looks interesting."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Cough , cough ""No Heath Ledger ,Cough"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this movie related to the previous life of the joker of Batman?????
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wonderful story I expect
-_DJEzZk2pc,‡Æú‡Øã‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Æ∞‡Øç..üëëüëë
-_DJEzZk2pc,It‚Äôs like depression dumped in paint
-_DJEzZk2pc,Well we want joker like sucide squard ..
-_DJEzZk2pc,They should have used suicide squad joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker Rocks Everywhere üëçüëç
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ok DC, you have my attention. Please don't lose it again.

Seriously, i love the feeling that this trailer gives off.... That the Joker is a product of Gotham, not the other way around. Ledger's Joker was great, but it really felt like he had the entirety of Gotham at his fingertips in his movie. I also love the fact that there isn't a single mention of Batman anywhere... it feeds into the whole 'made by gotham' theme. Batman didn't make the Joker who he was either.... (atleast this Joker...XD)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"More of a dark knight vibe, this is how dc should make there films"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Okay, but he needs to color his hair blonde before he can color it green"
-_DJEzZk2pc,It is from The Killing Joke? Oh God so excited to wait
-_DJEzZk2pc,There better be some crazy shit in that movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,No killing spree ? :(
-_DJEzZk2pc,Great trailer....
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can't wait to see this. From what I can see from the trailer is that Joaquin makes an excellent Joker and that the man can act.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks surprisingly good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fucking awesome
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I never thought Jimmy Durante could be scary until I saw this. 

Joker and Harley Quinn are my two favorite villains.  I loved the Harley character in Suicide Squad; Leto's joker was...let's say it would have been excellently played if it was any character OTHER then Joker. I mean that was one mean whacked out dude for sure! Deliciously twisted... but not Joker.  Leto played the role like a harlequin gone bad, Joker is anything but. 

Ledger's joker blew me away! Steal a scene or two from Bats? Yea right Ledger stole the whole damn movie from Bats and laughed all the way home! Phoenix is a damn fine actor. This plot is a whole new twist on the character tropes that have piled up over the decades. It looks yummy I can't wait to see it!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"‚ÄúWhy so serious?‚Äù

It‚Äôs just a family-friendly comedy.

Let‚Äôs just all have a good laugh, shall we? :‚Ä¢D"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Give me a smile
-_DJEzZk2pc,The Best Joker so far is in The Dark Knight - amazing movie!

-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks stupid ill pass
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""Worst part of having mental illness is

-_DJEzZk2pc,#whysoserious
-_DJEzZk2pc,Meh. Looks dumb.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks like shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This movie will prove why joker is an idea , he didn't need to fall into a vat of chemicals to be born neither his name need to be jack napier nor he need a purple suit."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where the haters at?? Ain't none
-_DJEzZk2pc,So The Joker's real name was Arthur.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is the perfect role for Joaquin Phoenix.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why so serious
-_DJEzZk2pc,I am honestly too scared to voice my opinion on this trailer for fear of getting torn to shreds by DC fans.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This will create havoc in the minds of people ...special mention #MUSIC
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now that looks like a real movie!Not like that Avengers and black panther¬†garbage !
-_DJEzZk2pc,Im sorry but every joker after ledger is a joke..
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Hate it, back story is all wrong for the joker and so is the way he goes about things .... the look is very classic and don't mind it as much as others but I think they tried to hard to make some thing different that it's turned into a completely different character"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Holy mother of fuck. Joaquin really seems to have the potential to be a damn great Joker. And  the fact it's not a repetitive CGI mess of fights and shit only makes it better,  it's a damn psychological thriller: just what the Joker character is perfect for. And the music is also totally in synch with the atmosphere of the trailer,  the symbolic stair, everything. Even if the movie flops, this was a near perfect trailer"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this a joke
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is why Marvel is slaughtering DC. After Aquaman we should've got Green Lantern or Martian Manhunter.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Holy shit, this is the guy from Gladiator?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is gonna suuuuuck
-_DJEzZk2pc,So stupid. Just another dark evil twisted film from HellyWood. Don't give your money to satan. Give it to God!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I wonder if he'll meet a burgeoning Spiderman in this origin story.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie looks like shit not gonna lie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not really great movie to wait for..
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC with a hit
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope this movie does well.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I like it. Humanized joker. Not that over the top act from jared leto.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The joker is a psychopath.  He was never a nice guy.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This man is going to be the next legend
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now I will come out my cave and go to the movies ‚ò∫
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this The Joker trailer or a Chicago documentary?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Cant fucking wait.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Heathledger
 *JOKER EVER*"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I just thank God it's not that leto guy again cause he sucked as the joker, worst joker ever! By far. No one can top ledgers joker but this might be a close second."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"1:20 Three guys in suits beating him up was a bit stupid. Token white collar assholes. There are other people on the subway more likely to beat up someone than people with careers that don‚Äôt want criminal records. Now I could be wrong, they could be the evil middle aged male suit gang or something."
-_DJEzZk2pc,1.52...... A young Bruce Wayne? ü§î

-_DJEzZk2pc,fucking... stoked!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hope this doesn't end up being another dc bomb. So far it does look good so there might be hope for this one.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I cant fucking wait to see this
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC should really make their movies dark like this. It suits their characters perfect

-_DJEzZk2pc,new chemical?
-_DJEzZk2pc,This look like garbage
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow, people are only pumping this up. Its just a trailer. Maybe watch the actual movie first before deciding if its ""oscar material""?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Perfect Example Of Dedication.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I actually prefer the Jared Leto joker .. minus forehead tattoo. But this should be ok.  Looks good, probably will be a great movie , but it could be called clown or bozo, because it will probably have nothing to do with the actual comic book Joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,It looks shitty
-_DJEzZk2pc,I love joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nope
-_DJEzZk2pc,Living personification of sad joker! Character and part came together as one. Once in a blue moon experience for Jouaqin Phoenix
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie will suck
-_DJEzZk2pc,TRASH. just a cheap ripoff of heath ledger.... Shame
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Why are all the comic book movies always about the same characters. These producers realize there are thousands of other heroes and villains to make movies about, right?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"What I like too is that this Joker actually looks like the every day person, he's not over the top with tattoos or trying to look sexy and gangsta but just 100% joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This looks cool... but tbh .. I don't like that it doesn't fit the DC story. Everyone who watched a few seasons of ""Gotham"" knows what I'm talking about. The real origin story is there, not in this movie"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Boring !! Im just gonna watch The Dark Knight again
-_DJEzZk2pc,Voice doesnt fit
-_DJEzZk2pc,I got this exact trailer as an ad before this vid
-_DJEzZk2pc,01:09 when ninja  loses a game

-_DJEzZk2pc,I bet the ending or post credit scene is gonna be the joker in prison or arkham seeing on tv that thomas and martha wayne were killed and he is gonna start laughing

-_DJEzZk2pc,Truly amazing... This trailer made me have that epic feeling and anticipation when I saw the trailer for Batman Begins! TDK Trilogy was epic and this trailer gives me hope. October can't arrive soon enough!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Just the trailer and already it's better than Jared leto
-_DJEzZk2pc,So is he a villain or a guy getting beat up?
-_DJEzZk2pc,omg what a acting man
-_DJEzZk2pc,@ 0:16 Yo that's Anderson Ave in the Bronx at the top.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this a prequel to the dark knight or has it anything at all to do with the Nolan movies?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not my Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"there ain't any joker without the bat, which is why the whole hollywood effort here does not make any sense to me"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"In the future, there maybe penguin movie, catwoman, scarecrow, poison ivy, robin and many...."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"you know what I like how DC is creating a more mature based universe in its entirety then marvel. DC seems to be more appreciative of its audience, and more respectful too by not making it silly, cartoonish and comic book like. This looks like not just a movie with the jokers origin story, but a movie with an underlying social message as well. GREATNESS! #Joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,No one can beat heath ledgers joker but on the other hand this joker‚Äôs pending
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ugh no thank you. What is this? God it looks awful. Joker is maniacally insane. Why are you trying to explain why? Why can't our villains be villains and our heros be heros? Just stop. You will never outperform Heath or Mark. (I would watch a Mark Hamill Joker movie as long as he get's all the say about his character.) Oh what am I even wasting my breath on. This is just another awful DC movie adaptation from people who have no talent FOR people with no taste. Yall have Dark Knight and that's it.

All you sheep saying this looks good are a bunch of low standard retards. You may enjoy eating shit, and I can't stop you, but don't be surprised at the disgust on my face when I see you eating shit."
-_DJEzZk2pc,In this movie Joker was portrayed as a hero who slowly became the villain. He had lived long enough to see himself turn into the Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I was really iffy about this but the more I watch it the more I love it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I know I'm in the minority, but to me the joker never made sense.  This character seems to make sense.  If the story plays out like it seems to, it makes The Joker the true opposite number to Batman.  We see him get beaten down over and over and always trying to take it on the chin, opposed to Bruce having ONE tragic moment which changes him at his core.  When The Joker snaps, he goes bad, but has he suffered so badly it's his only way of making sense of the world?  Is his reaction a release from a morality which has never served him well anyway?  I'm excited that I find myself asking questions about the character as if I might find answers beyond ""He's crazy and loves to kill people."""
-_DJEzZk2pc,THE LAST OF US font? wtf dc?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"He looks like the Joker I've always imagined, when thinking about a real life appearance of him. :)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,It would be a good movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Y‚Äôall delusional... this is a Fail üëéüèΩ
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh my oh my this is going to be amazing!!! I am super excited
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Holy shit, that transformation!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Phoenix joker is damn close to helth Legers. Nice.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please dont get any ideas boys
-_DJEzZk2pc,The music is absolutely gorgeous on this!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hello future commentsüëãüèº
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks soo dumb..... probably the one character that doesnt need a origin story.... DC really lost it first with their there are 3 jokers instead off just 1 ... now this making Joker another sad story trying to make an intelligent deep  movie and it looks ... just like more garbage
-_DJEzZk2pc,üí¨üí¨üí¨Finally Warner are doing something right. This looks really good. Do stand alone films Warner. The DCEU is terrible
-_DJEzZk2pc,To be honest i expected something different and i am a little bit dissapointed. But i guess i will give it a try
-_DJEzZk2pc,What age is this movie cause I really wanna watch it but I might not be aloud cause in 11
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""I was bullied so now im going to kill everybody"". Yeah thats a great message for kids, and definitely a lame origin story for the Jokers standard. 

Yes i know this is supposed to be outside the dc universe with ledo"
-_DJEzZk2pc,You wanna know how I got these scars
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gracefully and chaotically falling into despair...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Well that looks like it's gonna be really good. I don't know if anyone can out do Ledger's Joker but it seems like Ledger made the Joker character who he is and now everyone is trying to play ledger's joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Maybe
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ï¢ãÎã§~ Í∏∞ÎåÄÌï¥Î≥¥Ïûê

-_DJEzZk2pc,This guy looks like a younger Tall Man (Phantasm).
-_DJEzZk2pc,"That's what I hate about DC.  They just keep remaking.  Jared Leto Joker in Suicide Squad was a good character.  That should've been Joker.  Not Phoenix.  Here's to hoping DC doesn't get more retarded.  Ben Affleck as Batman is a joke.  Now this.  Man of Steel is the best DC movie in existence.  I will not watch this movie.  I'm satisfied with the past Jokers.  Jack Nicholson, Heath Ledger, Jared Leto.  Media is trying to kill DC comics.  And working on Marvel.  They want to trade Capt America for some nobody that won't fit in.  I'm about done with all these movies.  I'd rather play the video games.  At least they're not as stupid as these movies are getting.  (actors)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Slow fall to insanity? Good enough, might watch."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks something different..
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Perfect fit...so glad to see him getting a good role, and get his shit back together. Always been a fan of Phoenix!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks crap to me wtf.. He not a good joker at all tut tut
-_DJEzZk2pc,Life is a comedy and I am the joke.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin is perfect for this role. No one can actually become the character they‚Äôre portraying like he does. The guy‚Äôs a genius. I‚Äôve been saying that for years.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I smell an Oscar
-_DJEzZk2pc,I adore joker now.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This does not look good just saying
-_DJEzZk2pc,Another masterpiece...
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie looks like trash. Why do they keep messing up the joker?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I gotta say dc have a great villain...
-_DJEzZk2pc,100% must watch
-_DJEzZk2pc,He only smoked ones in the behind scenes he is like chimney üòÇüòÇ
-_DJEzZk2pc,now that was fucking acting
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Marvel: Endgame







DC: hold my bear"
-_DJEzZk2pc,No comment
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow! They are so lucky Phoenix had interest in the film he‚Äôs the best and highly underrated.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally the found another joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Worst
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks gay af
-_DJEzZk2pc,How can you do this without Batman? It's gonna BOMB!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ew for someone like the JOKER they should have cast someone who's more scary,  interesting, and has like a pereonality. But this guy idk hes cringey makes he feel uncomfortable. EVEN the background colors DC, like why u always make it look like mud water?! DC why are u like this???üò†"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Mark my words , he will get Oscar."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Beutiful
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin is a great choice but man it‚Äôs basically impossible to top Heath, he owns the role, the rest will forever be imitators"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Idk know about this one, The Joker is a tricky role, after Ledger idk if anyone can touch this role but maybe Phoenix pulls through. 


I hope so


Lets see!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"What a trailer. Had goosebumps. This should be a successful movie for DC. Joaquin Phoenix does look promising in the trailer. Hope he does justice to the character. 
Can't imagine any 1 but Heath ledger as JOKER. He took JOKER to the unimaginable heights. Missing him so soo much. RIP Heath ledger."
-_DJEzZk2pc,i like how the main actor is as possibly similar to heath ledger as possible so people would like the movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""I used to think that my life was a tragedy.  Now, I realize It's a comedy.""

That's when you know that your life has hit rock bottom, and somehow, it's gotten even below that."
-_DJEzZk2pc,00:45 what is happening here?
-_DJEzZk2pc,what an amazing trailer.  what if it went even more artsy and we saw Batman as a midget for the first time!  that would be kray kray!
-_DJEzZk2pc,meh
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I feel bad for joker, he seems like a friendly person"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Holy Shit it‚Äôs going to be a good movie!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Commodus
-_DJEzZk2pc,"You guys, its just a trailer but I already cried!


Maybe I just love whatever character Joaquin plays

But this is beautiful beautiful beautiful"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally! A properly detailed background to his present.
-_DJEzZk2pc,it's Villain's time to take the stage! so who will he fight then?
-_DJEzZk2pc,This will be a masterpiece
-_DJEzZk2pc,Trevor what did you turned into?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joker doesn‚Äôt seem to be scary, this movie is 2/10"
-_DJEzZk2pc,‡¥Æ‡¥≤‡¥Ø‡¥æ‡¥≥‡µÄ‡¥∏‡µç ‡¥â‡¥£‡µç‡¥ü‡µã
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks horrendous
-_DJEzZk2pc,why no one commenting on the great cinematography
-_DJEzZk2pc,The shape of joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Time to ruin another major name hu?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joker is back!!!!
Look at his acting skills, he just naile it.
Mannnn!!!!!! 
He deserves Oscar"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger nobody will ever compare.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm looking forward to this movie because I love the Joker and JP the actor. Looks like it's going along the premise that the quiet minority of people who are different than The Great Beast of Society get bullied until they stand up, realize all judges are self-appointed without any truth, and turn the tables and judge their oppressors. Being normal means hiding how different you are. Funny how what an individual does is always a crime unless the majority does it. Then it is as Holy and Sinless as a God who murders, gets jealous, rapes an underage Jewish virgin to create his deadbeat baby to dump on another. This flick will be goth and great. Bring it on!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Are we suppose to feel bad for the joker now üòÇ
-_DJEzZk2pc,So is this movie cannon? Like is it part of the DC universe or is it a stand alone thing?

-_DJEzZk2pc,Not much impact in his reading üìñ
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is Joaquin will have some recovery after the movie finished ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please let this be real...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sorry but there will never be a better played joker by a actor then Heath Ledger.....
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nope.  Hard pass.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel bad for this joker and feel like he actually has the right to be insane considering the shitty ass life he was put into without any chance of redemption
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don‚Äôt know guys... I was hoping for something more intense! Like him being abused by his dad or gettin kidnapped and somebody else cutting his face... :/
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix as Joker is a no.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Watching this puts a smile on my face
-_DJEzZk2pc,Meh i have to see the movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,"You always see comments on youtube complaining there aren't any great actors like the old days. Bullshit. Joaquin Phoenix stands with the best of them. He becomes his character. The Joker is one of the great roles to bring out the best in an actor, I assure you he'll knock this one out of the park."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If any of y'all have a time machine can ya swoop by and pick me up so we can see this now , I'll treat?!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can't stop watching the trailer!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wish Law Abiding Citizen got more coverage. Love movies like these.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôve rewatched the trailer and I can honestly say I‚Äôm rooting for the villain. Sorry Batman.
-_DJEzZk2pc,*so this is meant to be some sort of origin story of the start of the joker? If so could have used a younger actor this is going to be a boring movie in my opinion*
-_DJEzZk2pc,Shit gonna be fire!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I would rather watch garbage steam in a pile before wasting money on this movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow such a good trailer!
I've always been marvel only, but this looks dope ngl"
-_DJEzZk2pc,best bit was 2:09 scene. shows he really gave in to his insanity
-_DJEzZk2pc,WOW!!! AMAZING JOKER!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is the PENGUIN's story you motherfucking morons! Joker was mad by nature for no reason other than bringing chaos.
-_DJEzZk2pc,did anyone say Oscar bait?
-_DJEzZk2pc,If heath ledger was alive he would be alive and play this role it wouldbe so fucking awesome
-_DJEzZk2pc,His walking style is so joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,That mother fucking laugh O M G
-_DJEzZk2pc,"My problem with this is the movie is it's not connected to anything.. the comics or the current DC universe that exists in the movies. Are they planning on having a ""Detective Movies"" universe if this does well to exist along side their current DC Universe? I just don't get why they are releasing a movie that's got a made up story about an established character that's not going to go anywhere beyond ""he's the joker now"" and never fight Batman... Ever

I hope it's good, but I just don't get why they made this movie"
-_DJEzZk2pc,He will still be the evil Emperor in the Gladiator(Russle Crowe) movie in my heart.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"i hate looking at this sad stuff being the reason of what he became it just bums me out, still looks like a great movie tho"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gonna get hyped for another DC crap people XD !
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I think Everyone who Scares with clowns ( joker ) will start loving it, after watching this movie"
-_DJEzZk2pc,They need to get that kod who plays joker in Gotham hands down better then weve had for a while
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this a Disney movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,I dont like this already. The joker not post to have a back story. He doesn't even remember his own name. ITs like giving michael myers a reason why he kills. You dont do it. Dislike this already
-_DJEzZk2pc,I like him better as a bearded dj!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""I used to think my life was a tragedy... 
...But now I realize it's a comedy""
Then tell a god damn joke. This trailer felt like it tried a bit too hard to be serious. The Joker should be having fun."
-_DJEzZk2pc,New Joker = Mindfuck (by the society)
-_DJEzZk2pc,"*Joker*
Can't wait for the Movie
1st DC movie M More Eager to watch then Marvel's *Endgame*

I used to think  my life was a *Tragedy*
But now I  realised Its a *Comedy*
- JoKeR üÉè"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is bar none the best trailer I have seen in years. I am actually excited to see a super hero film in I don't know how long.
-_DJEzZk2pc,all time hit
-_DJEzZk2pc,"looks dark, i love it. should have gave it the killing joke origin, though."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joker isn't just another super villain, He is THE SUPER VILLAIN......."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Azta k.. a de beteg, Heath Ledger √≥ta, nem hittem h. lehet m√©g durv√°bbüòÆüòüüòß"
-_DJEzZk2pc,So... some mediocre white man fails to live up to society's definition of success and goes on a killing spree as a result? Why do I need to pay to see a movie of that? I can just turn on the news.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"When DC hits the deepness just right....
Me: It's one step closer to victory..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally a joker who is not trying to imitate ledger and bringing his own joker vibe .
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Im soooo hyped for this, after the suicide squad fiasco.."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Im soooo hyped for this, after the suicide squad fiasco.."
-_DJEzZk2pc,this looks good!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not convinced
-_DJEzZk2pc,Have you sent a calling card?
-_DJEzZk2pc,what the fuck is this dog shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,hit the Like When You LoVE Bateman
-_DJEzZk2pc,This trailer does say a lot about our society
-_DJEzZk2pc,Who else had the great trailer for a and before the video
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like straight trash
-_DJEzZk2pc,ok... but where is Batman???.. it's like jelly with no Toast... WTF
-_DJEzZk2pc,Did they release this trailer the day before Heath Ledgers birthday on purpose? Either way he seems to have a great successor to the joker character.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I See an Oscar.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Finally,  a Joker. :)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,After watching Gotham and seeing Cameron Monaghan play 2 of DC's Jokers (the fun loving laughing version and the dark insane version) it is going to be hard for anyone to match him!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I am on your side Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"To prepare for the role of the joker in this film, Joaquin Phoenix became a gamer, and lived in a society for 420 days"
-_DJEzZk2pc,AMAZINNGGGGGG
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks really boring and shit imo
-_DJEzZk2pc,I smell an Oscar....
-_DJEzZk2pc,a GOOD dc film? I‚Äôll believe it when I see it
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Good buy MCU !!!
This looks really good. Can‚Äôt wait for this one. Joaquin Phoenix always delivers on screen."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Please WB! Make it a hard R- Rated, Dark, Brooding & Violent film."
-_DJEzZk2pc,If this is going to be aligned in the time line with the rest of the Batman universe and how he is slowly turning into the joker then at the end it should show Batman and the ‚Äúhappy chemicals‚Äù accident
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can't tell if it's a psychopath / serial killer type movie or a real comedy
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie is going to fucking Suck
-_DJEzZk2pc,I miss the scars
-_DJEzZk2pc,Will never be as good as heath ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm sorry to bring down the mood but... Remember that guy that shot up a cinema, thinking he was the joker?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It‚Äôs twisted and claustrophobic, like somethings about to pop, and release the Joker, looks great"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow,i love this so much"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow
-_DJEzZk2pc,COMMODUS!!!!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Until this movie was mentioned and I saw this trailer I never realized how Joaquin Phoenix looks like the Joker, he has a weird face and he is a goofball in real life so its almost perfect. Going to be a hit and make him a star again."
-_DJEzZk2pc,eh
-_DJEzZk2pc,His back made me cringe üò´üò´
-_DJEzZk2pc,It is extremely fitting considering that Joaqin Pheonix is actually BAT SHIT CRAZY. Lets not forget his midlife crisis rap career...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Kinda looks like shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope it doesnt suck like Batman did
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope the movie doesn‚Äôt disappoint because this looks soooooo good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where's batman?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks interesting, curious as to what finally drove him over the edge. Did something happen to his family...?????"
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:04 What (epic)
-_DJEzZk2pc,That laugh 1:09 is kinda creepy. Reminds me of Batman: Killing joke movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I like letos joker in suicide squad better.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I believe Robin Williams may have made a good joker. He had a lot in infliction and cadence in his voice. I imagine he could have come up with voices and argue with himself. He had a talent for being spontaneous which would be cool if it was adapted into schizophrenia.
-_DJEzZk2pc,You guys take your Joker seriously! üòÇ
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks good but still no Heath Ledger.
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:51 fun part is that the kid is bruce and about 20 years later he will put his hand on joker face but as a punch
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nobody can replace Ledger.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This might be on marvel production level holy shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I like to think that Arthur was the first joker, and maybe was the inspiration for Ledgers joker present day."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix is great as always
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:13 Sh*t dont look like he was acting.....I LOVE IT!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Missing heath Ledger in this role..
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope the movie is as dark as this trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Finally a movie based a super hero movie that focuses on what makes hero/villain movies interesting. The character, not their actions."
-_DJEzZk2pc,holly shit this ones gonna be awesome.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Aswam..
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like it‚Äôs gunna be a flop tbh
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It looks so good, now let's just hope that it actually is"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hate these movies...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is Joker supposed to be the hero in this movie?
-_DJEzZk2pc,*immense dread*
-_DJEzZk2pc,"You know when you're walking along and you see a guy holding a sign and you knock it out of his hands (like you do) and then you have to stop going wherever it was you were going and take the time out of your day to run away with the sign so you can ambush the guy in an alley and hit him with the sign before you can go on with your day? Clowns, am I right?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think he starts killing or thinks about it when he's getting beat in the train by those assholes
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this a origin story?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is Penguin's story, not the Joker's you goddam stupid motherfuckers!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I like the two shots of him walking on the stairs. As Arthur he is struggling to walk up the stairs, but as the Joker he skillfully and gleefully dances down the same stairs. Neat little touch."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I guess in a cruel world, we all have a joker inside of us that helps us cope with reality."
-_DJEzZk2pc,KINO ALERT KINO ALERT KINO ALERT KINO ALERT
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I hope they take elements from ""the killing game"" - namely that the only thing separating us from Joker is, ""one bad day"" üÉè"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"holy shit.the song...the cinematography ...the editing...all of it makes me shudder watching it...and yet i cant peel my eyes from the screen.


ive had my reservation of resurrecting the joker..i thought he should be buried with heath for at least another 5 more years...but damn...this...is epic."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sounds like Flea??
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Fuck this crap, it's insulting to Ledger's memory!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Am i the only one who thinks this looks like another hollywood piece of shit movie?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sorry this looks dumb and they took wayyyy too many liberties on the character judging by this trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:35 I thought that was heath in the mirror üò≠
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks boring AF.
-_DJEzZk2pc,No one will ever do it better than Heath Ledger üòï
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hope I‚Äôm wrong but this looks like shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,Again new joker? Heath ledger die in vain
-_DJEzZk2pc,An insult to heath ledger.
-_DJEzZk2pc,No one will ever touch heath ledger but wow this guy is the next best thing imo.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The style they're doing here for Joker is definitely one I've never seen. A kind, but overly naive, man who eventually snaps from an immature goof to a wild psychopath. I'm excited."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I am saw this Tralier more than 50 times we are love you DC DC for ever
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ohh my god ! It was really impressive hard work and performance of all joker team members it was going to be a real super human story who becomes a super killer
-_DJEzZk2pc,What's going on??
-_DJEzZk2pc,That music is just spot on
-_DJEzZk2pc,He is best joker ever! Change my mind
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Phoenix used to get a lot of shit, but I think people are finally realizing hes one helluva an actor"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gamers rise up
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Feels like they took a few queues from ""The killing joke"" comic on this."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Did not realize the mc character, first i cringed, then whoo"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Holy shit. üò±
-_DJEzZk2pc,Love this Joker üÉè
-_DJEzZk2pc,*Joaquin Phoenix falls down: The Movie*
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin just might just might be a better joker than heath... This trailer is AMAZING!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wht a piece of feminist sht
-_DJEzZk2pc,This DEFINITELY has my attention.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Umm, the Joker does not need an origin story really, and is NOT a sympathetic villain."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"That thumbnail has me literally dying, nigga looking stupid af."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Showing a regular guy transition to a complete psychopath? I'm definently watching this. Joaquin Phoenix looks like he nailed it!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"this trailer made me re-think the joker completely. I used to think he was just a madman lashing out at the world. Now I'm starting to think that he believes he is helping the world. He figured that the only way to be happy in a world this messed up was to become so broken that you turn pain into pleasure. So he aims to make everyone as broken as he has become. So everyone is happy. In a twisted way, he's the good guy in his mind."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Since we only have the trailer to go off, Heath is still the #1 Joker. Heath used to stay in character away from shooting and would do his own makeup for realism, Harley wasn't around to do Jokers makeup for him."
-_DJEzZk2pc,The Dark Night movie made the Joker more famous then Batman.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This trailer looks horrible.  I hope that means they saved the good parts for the movie or else I'd expect Suicide Squad ratings all over again.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm pissed at that they aren't using gerrad
-_DJEzZk2pc,Bruce wayne parents death scene?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So DC pretty much just said, Fuck Jared Letoü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm excited
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks okay, pretty dark though."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Marvel suddenly looks ridiculous
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is he deformed in this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Surprisingly, this looks good."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Give this man an OSCAR...!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Whether the movie turns out to be good or bad it's still looks a million times better than Leto's Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The movie nobody wanted
-_DJEzZk2pc,I just came a little...
-_DJEzZk2pc,I waiting  movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yeah this dude ain't eaten since the production started...hope he gets a big mac soon
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gamers shall rise.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"He's already the best Joker, and the movie hasn't even come out yet... props to Joaquin Phoenix"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Heath Ledger and Jared Leto killed it 
This is a joke üòë"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Meh.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm sorry, but I just have to say I think the Joker from Suicide Squad deserves his own movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel so bad for joker for some reason
-_DJEzZk2pc,I haven't had true genuine chills for a flick in a long time. This had me completely stuck. Wow!‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I have loved Joaquin Phoenix nearly my whole life, I hope he does so well in this movie and people don‚Äôt bash him for it"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Chills
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Officially my 50th time of watching this trailer, and im not stopping."
-_DJEzZk2pc,To be honest I'm not super keen on a joker origin movie. But this does look good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dude I'm getting weird vibes of that joker novel from this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,üòÅ
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Oohhhh... YYEEEAAAAHHHHH! (THIS, is Gotham's finest individual!) This mofo is the end result of not giving a F!@#$CK!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now this is a good Joker. Unlike the Rip-off in Suicide Squad
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I just rewatched the dark knight less than 24 hrs ago soooo... I wish yall the best but I don't think this is going to fill my appetite. Then again ""why so serious? "" I hope this movie proves me wrong. ;-)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC!!!! I'M ONLY GOING TO SAY THIS ONCE!!!! PLEASE DO THIS RIGHT! JOAQUIN PHOENIX DESERVES THIS!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I never thoughts my own favourite actor will lead this role....... Dislike r biber fans
-_DJEzZk2pc,Haven‚Äôt been this excited for a movie in a while

-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh boy this trailer looks good they going to screw up this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope there is evil action in this film.
-_DJEzZk2pc,It‚Äôs a movie about mental illness disguised as a superhero movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is dope..
-_DJEzZk2pc,This better be rated R
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Mark Hamill plays an awesome trickster in the flash, with some makeup, he might be able to also play the joker live action."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Meh, just meh."

-_DJEzZk2pc,We trully live in a society
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Society Turn him to joker *√ó*

Rude New Yorkers Turn him to joker *‚úì*"
-_DJEzZk2pc,so BATMAN will be the BAD GUY here?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker said ‚Äúall it takes is one bad day‚Äù
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath  Ledger would be proud!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yeah he will be a great joker but dark knight is a top 10 5 movies of all time thats why ledger is the goat.
-_DJEzZk2pc,STUPIDDDDDEEEEERRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,That's more like it!
-_DJEzZk2pc,WHAT??
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not as good as the show gotham with Jerome valeska
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now this is a trailer! üôå
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks like shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,"That first smile, wow, i am sold already... it gave me the chills at the end and put my happy face on :D"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"In my opinion, this version is like a modern version of Cesar Romero and a hint of Heath Ledger."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"0:14 he climbs stair sadly, 2:15 he climbs down happily... Thats the joker i need. üòé"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope this movie is good. I've been let down by DC so im sceptical.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks very exciting, but DC always disappointed me. Hope this won‚Äôt."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"heath push the bar and set the standard.  Some fail, some not even close. i got a feeling that Joaquin would manages to pull it off.  who needs CGI if u can do it w/ emotion."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Welp, don‚Äôt need to see this ad anymore cuz the ad for this ad was this ad."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Evolution of that crazy laugh..... I need that as my ringtone.

-_DJEzZk2pc,Why the hell do I feel some heath in this
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm hoping that scene with a kid happens before he snaps, or that he kills the kid shortly after, which sounds messed up I know, but the Joker isn't supposed to be a good person, even when he has a just cause he goes about it in the most messed up way imaginable. I don't mind him being a good guy crushed by a crime world, I can stand him being charismatic enough to squire a cult following, but once he's broken I don't want him doing anything as humanizing as taking care of a child, once he's broken there is no down time for him to be a good person in, once he's the Joker he is always the Joker and either by choice or consequence the Joker does not feel empathy. 

I'm still hopefully optimistic, and I'm sure a truecomic fan can bring up several instances where the Joker behaves in a manner opposing to my opinion, this is just how I feel right now."

-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie will flop big time.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Why do I get the feeling this movie will feature a cameo from the new Batman and will be a reboot of the DCEU?? 
Also, does anybody else think the kid shown here is Bruce Wayne?"

-_DJEzZk2pc,A version of the origins of greatest super-villain in the history of comic books!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now we know the ending now i dont have to waste money
-_DJEzZk2pc,I wonder what Raj Kapoor's film Mera Naam Joker would have turned out if it had joker like this one
-_DJEzZk2pc,This really reminds me of the tone of Kidding. Jim Carrey would also probably make an intriguing Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm sure we haven't seen a Joker like this since Heath Ledger. Can't wait to see this MOVIE

-_DJEzZk2pc,Like and become rich
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This trailer says so much! So many nods to old films, Taxi Driver and maybe even Excorcist...just by the imagery of those long steps. As if to show a man battling inner demons...walking up the stairs in a broken, tortured, hunched over state. By the end of the trailer, he's fully embraced and taken over by those demons. Free and dancing triumphantly down those same steps as the person he's meant to be...the prince of crime."

We want dark.
We want a good story. 
I hope this is it and there's more good ones to come from you all."

-_DJEzZk2pc,Whoever cut this trailer is a genius
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks so good. I knew Joaquin Phoenix would do the Joker right. Such an amazing actor... Very excited to see this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This totally makes up for Jared Leto.

I‚Äôm actually thinking that The three 21st century film jokers are proof of the Three Joker theory. Leto is the cartoon Joker who was transformed when the former Joker captured and turned Robin. Ledger is the middle Joker who worked during Batman‚Äôs prime. And now we get to see the original Joker from when Bruce was a child."
-_DJEzZk2pc,have you ever been so angry that you laughed like a maniac??
-_DJEzZk2pc,was that a young Bruce Wayne behind the gate?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I wonder if this Joker would actually be funny.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Hollywood please stop messing up great comic book characters! Lame!!! Great actor, great Cinema , horrible story!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"did anyone else notice that...




...the jokers name is Arthur?!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Can we stop talking about Heath Ledger here? This is Joaquin Phoenix's Joker. Ledger was a great actor, but imo his Joker was a terrorist, not THE Joker, and his Joker became overrated mostly because of his death. To me Phoenix is meant to be The Joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Warner finally gets it. let marvel do the bubblegum shit. This is DC baby!
-_DJEzZk2pc,The greatest joker trailer every !!!! (My opinion)! Great acting Joaquin !
-_DJEzZk2pc,Are you people on drugs? How are so many people saying good things about this drama BS.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Still would rather have Willem Dafoe
-_DJEzZk2pc,"My favorite villain character, sometimes I feel this way"
-_DJEzZk2pc,damn boi!that's all you had to upload bro!
-_DJEzZk2pc,this is kinda depressing but i like it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I miss Heath Ledger üòë this film should be dedicated to him. üò´
-_DJEzZk2pc,Apparently DC is out to ruin every single property they have . . .
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hope the Joker curse won't get him
-_DJEzZk2pc,"they nailed the trailer, not showing too much but enough to peak interest. psyched for this, music was perfect i got chills when joker walks out at the end"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"When they first announced this I was very worried but now I‚Äôm kinda curious/ excited to see this movie I really hope it‚Äôs good and gives us a great joker especially since the joker history is pretty good when it comes to interpretation. Heck people probably would have liked Jared Leto if they gave him more screen time, I just hope that it‚Äôs a good movie."

-_DJEzZk2pc,"This seems to be the best DC movie in this year,,,,great trailer"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"That looks totally badass.  Ultra dark, expertly conceived...and brilliantly acted.  Hope it lives up to the trailer!  Best joker yet, easily.  I'll bet that the kid whose mouth he makes into a smile is the young Bruce Wayne...."

-_DJEzZk2pc,"*Madness as you know, is like gravity. All it takes is a little push.*"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I really felt that mental breakdown laugh in the train
After a breakup with someone I dedicated 15 years of my life making her smile and finally got to date her and it was great, we both were laughing but then she just dumps me and replaced me without warning, all that time wasted on someone who I saw was my soulmate just taken away and a month or two later all I could think was my life being a big joke and I laughed like a maniac (while driving) 
I just scared my self but at the same time it just fueled more laughter that I actually cared about my joke filled life 

That was 2 years ago but that laugh still haunts me a little 
A laugh that just sounded like I had nothing to lose anymore and just let go of humanity for a few minutes"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"He‚Äôs not the bad guy, he‚Äôs the hero we all deserve...    - Society"

-_DJEzZk2pc,Not liking it
-_DJEzZk2pc,Anyone else think the background song is sung by Larry David?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This makes me think that, if successful, DC will make more of these stand alone films that don't need to be propped up by a universe. Which means, Under the Red Hood, The Long Halloween, Court of Owls, Superman Red Son (ooh the controversy!), etc etc..well, here's to hoping ü§ûü§û"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Pennywise and now a legit Joker movie? The fear of clowns is real!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Never been a fan of joker a day in my life but this movie might change my mind can‚Äôt wait
-_DJEzZk2pc,"They could make this work in the dceu if they say jarred letto‚Äôs joker was just a fan boy of the original, (this one)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,They got it right!üñ§
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hopefully this Joker doesn't go and die on us
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don't like this hipster joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Actually with this trailer, I feel sad for this Joker... :( he needs a big huge... poor Arthur.
F"
-_DJEzZk2pc,They need to put icp in this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Idk???
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow....this looks good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,They Should Make This The Official Origin of The Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin channeling Travis Bickle. Excellent.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Yall need to calm down with the Jared Leto hate. He did a great job in suicide squad. He was probably my fav part of the movie.

As for Joaquin Phoenix,  im sure hes going to do a great job too. So far Heath Ledger, Jared Leto and Joaquin Phoenix are bringing/brought great portrayals of the joker, so stfu and enjoy good acting."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Jared Letos Joker is Joker Jr, or Tim Drake, who was brainwashed by the Joker."

-_DJEzZk2pc,"1:27 we see the first real Joker's laugh!
And the piano gets crazy! And music gets better"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"That long stairway featured multiple times is so symbolic... at the beginning, he climbs up every day as he is trying to be good, to bring joy and happiness, trying to believe that the world is good. Eventually, though, he accepts that society is insane and, in the last scene, he dances his way back down the steps. He has given up trying to be good and accepted what people have made him. He finally seems happy."
-_DJEzZk2pc,0:44 Joker's voice starts changing to a psychos one!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like it‚Äôs gonna be ass tbh
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Doesn't look that good.

ME ENCANTA lpm"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"That's amazing,  because when I see French people talking about the joker's trailer, they say it's gonna be a bad joker, a bad movie, but when I come here I see everybody say good thing about this movie, so I'm happy."
-_DJEzZk2pc,The trailer isn't great... but I'd rather them hide everything in the actual movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks epic
-_DJEzZk2pc,Let put the smile on that FACE!
-_DJEzZk2pc,this is real acting
-_DJEzZk2pc,This makes me remember why I liked being a juggalo...  i miss wearing clown makeup...
-_DJEzZk2pc,I always knew The Joker was a momma‚Äôs boy
-_DJEzZk2pc,This whole trailer gave me chills
-_DJEzZk2pc,Am I the only one feeling like DC has messed up again I mean dang...I want to see the joker not a psycho in clown makeup. There is a difference people!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is going to be sickkk
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This looks kind of wack, the costume design is a little iffy and the interpretation of the Joker's origin story just overall seems to be laking like there should be a major push for him to go over the edge. Like how in the dark knight the joker had got his scars from his father cutting him and stuff like that. Who knows how this is gonna, in the end, turn out, but for now I'm disappointed because the joker is my favorite villain of all times and this does not do him justice."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ok, this is great as a trailer, it might be even better as a movie but as the character that is supposed to be Batman's nemesis, I don't know. I mean, to be Batman's nemesis the Joker needs as a full flagged villain something else than just social pressure and existencial angst. Just saying, lets see, It has a lot of potential."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I wanna go to see now
-_DJEzZk2pc,"this is the way, dc"
-_DJEzZk2pc,What universe does this take place in?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I feel sorry for him, but am somehow completely terrified by him as well"
-_DJEzZk2pc,When you take the clown pill.
-_DJEzZk2pc,who all are watching this and missing Heath Ledger?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Finally DC realized that their horrifying, depressing, dark tone only works for telling supervillain stories. I might actually look forward to one of their movies now."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don‚Äôt know about this I really don‚Äôt want a Joker movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,That laugh in the train was so perfect
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is going to be like suicide squad
-_DJEzZk2pc,They say if you live to see enough you live to see yourself turn into a villian #facts.
-_DJEzZk2pc,NETA QUE CHINGON
-_DJEzZk2pc,Kinda like Dark knight feeling looks epic
-_DJEzZk2pc,So a fake trailer has 10m views but this is just over 1.2m come on people!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""This does put a smile on my face"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,the worst trailer ever redo the hole thing
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm glad they went this direction with it. Marvel's movies are supposed to be flashy with humorous one liners. DC is supposed to be dark gritty, and in Joker's case disturbing."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yoooo
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm not feeling it, it makes the joker seem like a victim when really he is a villain are they trying to make him a sympathetic character etc"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sad 0:30
-_DJEzZk2pc,too much greatness.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Honestly was hyped hear about this movie but no it‚Äôs a flop there‚Äôs no Batman no nothing hope this isn‚Äôt the story line there gonna put with the dc joker this is shit imma go watch it just to be disappointed bring back the original joker not this society joker crap this should be called Arthur not Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"1:27 That laugh!
1:58 THE MUSIC!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ok from lame robber to villian? c'mon DC we had only accepted one joker, take the fuckin hint!


(dark knight joker btw)"

-_DJEzZk2pc,Takes him until the final second to put his only natural smile/smirk in the trailer.  All the others were forced
-_DJEzZk2pc,"When he is writing, he says, ""The worst part about having a mental illness, is that people expect you to behave as if you don't."""
-_DJEzZk2pc,We live in a society.................
-_DJEzZk2pc,I love the voice he's doing in this. He sounds like a child in an adult's body. It's kind of unnerving. I'm stoked.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This looks incredible. I feel like this is going to be a villain you can't help but feel bad for and understand. I mean, if I'd gone through what he goes through, I'd want the world to burn too."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gonna call it now and say the movie ends with him gunning down the Waynes.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This shit gave me a wicked bonah
-_DJEzZk2pc,His laugh was awesome not as good as the mark Hamel's joker but well done this movie looks amazing as an origin story I love the way they are going with this I home it wins several Oscars and who knows it could rival heath ledgers joker rest in peace pal we will miss you
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is the ""thinking man's"" Joker.
We have hundreds of thousands of the mentally ill on our streets... they are all ticking time bombs."

Why he still

-_DJEzZk2pc,we live in a society...
-_DJEzZk2pc,he looks so cool at the end
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks awful
-_DJEzZk2pc,Legends and imd say the kid is Bruce Wayne.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I see that this would be a good movie, but it‚Äôs not JOKER in my eyes"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh god oh fuck he‚Äôs going to say the N word. How can we keep letting gentleman gamers get away with this?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm very anti-trailer for things I know I want to see because I don't want ANYTHING spoiled. I made an exception for this because I was so curious. I do not regret that decision. My god this looks wonderful.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sounds dark and depressing
-_DJEzZk2pc,Epic
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why so serious DC ????

-_DJEzZk2pc,Dumb af pass
-_DJEzZk2pc,I just like that they are aiming to show more character to Joker rather than all smiles and craziness. Bravo!
-_DJEzZk2pc,No one like the first joker R.I.Püòî
-_DJEzZk2pc,So is this set in the dceu or is this just a spin-off
-_DJEzZk2pc,YOOOO AT THE START HE'S WALKING UP THE STAIRS BUT AT THE END HE'S JUMPING DOWN THEM THAT'S SO COOL!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"i came here expecting some ""meh"" thing but i'm leaving hyped!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This movie looks boring, and he looks stupid as fuck."
-_DJEzZk2pc,No joker tops heath Ledgers
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is that phil from modern family ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Got to say. Hes a good fit for the DC universe movies
-_DJEzZk2pc,"i don't know if i'm watching joaquin phoenix or heath ledger? i'm confused..
sure enough maybe this is an origin story of heath's joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Jesus, this is a fuckin' dumpster fire."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Plz don't make him the peoples hero or and antihero or anything but straight bad DC or I give up
-_DJEzZk2pc,*Heath*  *ledger* *has* *left* *the* *chat*
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Felt is should of been ""I used to think that my life was a tragedy, but now I realize it's a JOKE."" instead of ""a comedy."""
-_DJEzZk2pc,Disliked by stupid marvel bitch fans.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now ped0 Hollywood wants us to see a mass murderer like the joker as a good guy
-_DJEzZk2pc,You would half to pay me to see this garbage.
-_DJEzZk2pc,a lot of tough bois in this comment section wearing their tough boi pants. Show those youtube comments whose the real bad ass eh?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Psshhhhhh society amarite
-_DJEzZk2pc,Here after 100th time watching it
-_DJEzZk2pc,Still not as good as Heath
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fuckin stupid
-_DJEzZk2pc,"What a weird looking movie, has me intrigued. Hope it's good."
-_DJEzZk2pc,2:16üíôüëå
-_DJEzZk2pc,I would if it will release in may
-_DJEzZk2pc,It basically looks like he just gets his ass kicked the entire movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Anyone else having a shit right now?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ok so Joker gets his ass beaten 2 times but never killed anyone...weak
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is proof that we live in a society.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not a single explosion :/
-_DJEzZk2pc,We live in a society gamers rise up
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wonder how Warner bros is gonna make the old school batman look cool if their giving joker his old suit.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"My favorite part about the aesthetic of this movie so far is how unapologetically they contrast the grime and filth of the city with the clean, crisp colors and silhouette of Joker.  Dark Knight took him in a direction where his own clothing and makeup was really grotesque and disheveled, like he'd been living in a sewer for years.  It was an interesting take and I don't have anything against, but it was following the trend most movies do when they try to ground the costumes of superheros and villains in a more ""realistic"" way.  Of course, ""realistic"" usually just means darker, drabber and less ostentatious.  Here, once he's all dressed up, he just *stands out* against the backdrop of everything else, and seems completely alien to the environment in a really unnerving way.  Solid, bright colors, clean lines.  When I first saw that old test video they released I thought it looked awful and silly, but now I think it's amazing.  It still looks absolutely believable as a costume, but looks like something that shouldn't exist in the world in which it does.  *In a good way.*"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Was that kid Bruce Wayne?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wack
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker's reborn!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""you can't trust minorities these days, you gotta do everything yourself""

-Joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Justice served, the transformation is fucking awesome"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"NOW
I
SEE
THE
FUNNY
SIDEEEEEEEEE"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This trailer tells me nothing really. Just a montage of a stand up comic set to an old song.
-_DJEzZk2pc,ok so at the vbery least we can expect a fucking great performance and to have a great trailer to come back to ! lets hope the movie is as good
-_DJEzZk2pc,that kid is Wayne
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don't think there's a need to compare every Joker. It's pretty obvious everybody has put a different spin on this character. Nicholson was great. Ledger is awesome. Looks like Phoenix to be amazing. Leto sucked...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So a bunch of inner city kids made the Joker hate life? 
A guess we know why he hate everything, inner city, high crime. See where im going?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I just hope one day a live action Joker will use Joker toxin on his victims to make laugh until they die and leave a disturbing smile on their faces
-_DJEzZk2pc,I watched this trailer over 50 times it is addictive just as my favorite movie Bohemian Rhapsody I watched that trailer over 60 times
-_DJEzZk2pc,2:10 I don't know if the movie will be good but he will be an amazing Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I dont know if Id like this origin story but im still intrigued enough to watch. I think the killing joke would be a good live action movie they just need someone to do it right lol
-_DJEzZk2pc,Probably the first 100% good DC movie to date.
-_DJEzZk2pc,When he‚Äôs writing in the notebooks under jokes the one I can make out say the worst part of having mental issues is people expect you to behave as if you don‚Äôt. Phoenix is gonna crush this role he‚Äôs at his best playing psychologically nuanced roles like in you were never really here. Som pumped for this!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Am I the only one who thinks this makes the joker out to look weak? Heath Ledger did so well I think the books are closed. He was peak menacing. I think the joker‚Äôs origin has to be a bit mysterious and very presumably brutal- and this isn‚Äôt.
-_DJEzZk2pc,this looks terrible.
-_DJEzZk2pc,That's one way to put a smiiiile on that face!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The spinning circle of death never stops, is that the joke?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This shit is so artistically sadüòîüòîüòî
-_DJEzZk2pc,yes please
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fuck this nigga we want mac mill... oshit wrong person and video ü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
-_DJEzZk2pc,ON MY BIRTHDAYY!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,... 1:50 ...I bet... He is a little Bruce Wayne
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow... Oscar material I think... Joaquin plays the part well!
-_DJEzZk2pc,a$$
-_DJEzZk2pc,"To be honest, if he had the mouth scars it would‚Äôve been a great callback to heath ledgers joker, like if he did it cause of the way people were treating him, like if they don‚Äôt want a happy smiling clown they‚Äôll get a monster, or if it played into the depression side of it I think it could‚Äôve worked, let me know if I‚Äôm wrong or give your opinion"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think this maybe is a mix between taxi driver and the machinist
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now day i hope Joker can win his battle
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where‚Äôs Batman
-_DJEzZk2pc,Richtiger M√ºll
-_DJEzZk2pc,Incel: the Movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,I was so scared to play this video thinking they'd have screwed it again.  God I'm so proud of it.  DC forever
-_DJEzZk2pc,Who‚Äôs making this Warner brother‚Äôs?
-_DJEzZk2pc,so beautiful ‚ò∫Ô∏èüî™
-_DJEzZk2pc,"My relationship with the joker before trailer:üò°üò°
After:üòçüòç"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I liked Jared Leto
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wtf Is Robert geriatric Degenerate in this movie?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"There's an interesting thing to notice, the moment The Arkham Hospital receptionist is looking down at something and then back to Arthur with a nervous look. ""What?"" makes me think he read something terrible on his medical records, something like, this can't be real, you shouldn't be out there walking freely."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôm still waiting to see how this guy transitions from this into Jered Leto‚Äôs joker...
-_DJEzZk2pc,finalmente um filme desse universo q vale a pena assistir
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""Heath Ledger was the best Joker ever.""
Joaquin Phoenix: ""Hold my beer."" 
No brainer legendary actor. SURE WIN! Excited to use my money again on the big screen."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Itchy all over from goose bumps, this looks stunning"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Im very excited i only wish they would have kept the purple suit.. it just fits
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow...this is great,can't wait.The physical transformation from ""You were never really here"" to this,the effort,the dedication,plus i believe that the actor deserves way much more that some of these muppets in the business.I mean lady Gugu got an Oscar and this guy or people like him,true artists,are ignored...it's sad...Heath will watch this with joy."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I really wanna watch this, good job DC. It's been awhile since i've wanted to watch y'all's movies. 
Don't get me wrong I loved the Dark Knight movies and Wonder Woman along with some of y'all's animated but the newer ones I've kinda been distracted from when watching, IDK. 
(And yes, I know this channel isn't DC's but I'm just speaking as if it were cause idfk)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Just don‚Äôt give him an actual name like ‚ÄúJack‚Äù and I‚Äôll be okay with an origin story.
-_DJEzZk2pc,0:45 when I sit criss crossed on the shower floor
-_DJEzZk2pc,That's phil dunphy!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm not gonna knock it but I feel like itll be alot left out and a sequel
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's not a Joker movie I expected. To me it's a nother clown movie that might be PG-13 or rated R by DC. Now goes a fc villain movie in the garbage just like the past bad DC movies.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Not a bad origin for the Joker. I prefer the Joker's origin to be a mystery, but regardless I like the book origin from ""Killing Joke"", Tim Burton's movie Batman, and the Heath Ledger's portrayal."
-_DJEzZk2pc,All it takes is one bad day...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If you see a creepy clown laughing outloud by himself at night in a train, you don't engage him."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks fucking epic!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Holy shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,No no no not that punch is a problem!!!! It sounds so fake!!! Please please please fix that before the movie comes out
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Or you die a hero, or you live long enough to become a villain"

-_DJEzZk2pc,‚Äú in a perfect world ...‚Äù
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Come to think of it, have we EVER seen the origins of joker?? Bob kane and bill finger did the right thing making him this ambiguous so no continuity is betrayed. JK Rowling needs to take some notes lol"

-_DJEzZk2pc,Can't wait!!! Best back story so far!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Bruh  its only one joker man that one dude  form Batman theses clowns
-_DJEzZk2pc,The Jimmy Durante song is the scariest part of the whole trailer. It's creepy man!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger!!! We all summon you!!!!!! Come back!!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I think I actually side with Joker now, Fuck them kids BURN GOTHAM TO GROUND"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"this looks decent but I want the kind of Joker that walks down the street hitting people with a baseball bat, I hope it delivers"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Meh.. Idk. Nobody will ever play that role the way Heath Ledger did
-_DJEzZk2pc,Maybe he's not the real jocker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Should have stuck to the original story of him falling into a pool of chemicals and turning pale.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Willem Defoe would be a fantastic Joker but sadly he openly admitted that he felt he wouldn‚Äôt be good enough for the role.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I love how the first thing people notice after hearing ‚Äú my mother always said i have a purpose‚Äù is ‚ÄúDONT ;) ‚Äú
-_DJEzZk2pc,I stopped caring about DC movies after BvS but this looks good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,WOW!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Anyone know the song playing in the background?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Man I'm already pumped to see those dickheads get theirs. Sad to think about how the Joker ends up, even though he does some shitty shitlol"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks awful..
-_DJEzZk2pc,PERFECT. CASTING.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Because society failed him, the descent to madness begins....

so coool... can't wait for the movie"
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:09 is actually spine tingling
-_DJEzZk2pc,"People, please. Just because the trailer looks good doesn‚Äôt mean the film will be. Stop giving movies great criticism because of its trailer."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Marvel is so dead . I can see this getting an Oscar
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wear are the scars
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fuck yes.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hell yeah! Bring it on joaquin phoenix! He is gonna nail this role.
-_DJEzZk2pc,People have got to stop posting seemingly philosophical shit. It‚Äôs a movie about a clown that ends up being the main villain to an orphan in a bat suit. Leave the philosophical shit to the comics and analysis
-_DJEzZk2pc,Have you ever had a really bad day?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks retarded. Id rather see dumbo
-_DJEzZk2pc,"When I originally saw him in clown make-up o so long ago, I thought it was a John Gacy movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I don't think you can really say whose the better joker as they all portrayed him in their own and unique way of being comedic, dark, and brooding. Every person who played joker showed what they envisioned him to be."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Zoinkies
-_DJEzZk2pc,Much of this film was filmed in dirty jersey. How fitting.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks fuckin stupid..  this isn‚Äôt the Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I still don‚Äôt get why this was made
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fuuuuuuuuuuck yeah
-_DJEzZk2pc,He looks unnaturally underweight
-_DJEzZk2pc,this shit gonna be real sad
-_DJEzZk2pc,I miss Heath Ledger...he would have made this movie phenomenal!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please don't be disappointing. PLEASE.
-_DJEzZk2pc,REEEEEEEEEEE IM EXCITED FOR THIS MOVIE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHGhhhhh!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Me before watching this: what shit had they made of the joker!
Me after watching this: JOKER is killing me for the thing I thought before watching the trailer..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"its hard for me to imagine joaquin phoenix playing a good joker, but i said the same thing about heath ledger so i am ready to be proven wrong again"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"That‚Äôs an amazing origin, a simple kind and happy man driven into an evil monster by an evil society and world, a hell of a lot better than the classic origin with him just falling into a vat of radiation"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Meh
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like his big atrocity could be from tdkr when he murders the whole studio when on live TV being interviewed
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks painful to watch - meaning we will go into Joker's broken heart to see what made him snap.

Interesting, but dangerous."
-_DJEzZk2pc,If that is really a young Bruce Wayne he put a smile on there‚Äôs a chance to reboot the whole Batman vs Joker movie atmosphere..this could be an epic beginning
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm surprised they didn't show the ""far right"" creating the Joker.  Maybe in the transgender Joker origin movie coming out in 2021."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"2:10 2:18 chills, anyone know what's the music or is it original score? This looks great"
-_DJEzZk2pc,whaaattaafuckkk  whataaaaaafkkkk
-_DJEzZk2pc,The 993 dislikes are Batman fanboys.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Yup, it's white guys in suits who beat you up on the subway.  Been that way for decades and it's really gotta stop."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If any performance could match Heath‚Äôs, this might be it. We will see."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I want it to come out sooner it looks so cool I just wanna watch it soooooo... bad
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally getting real actors that can act.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow this new episode of Atlanta looks crazy. Is this the new Teddy Perkins? Van and Paper Boi looking great as well
-_DJEzZk2pc,The only thing I'm hoping is that the Joker becomes a villian and not a hero (it would be cool to see a movie about the origin of a villian)
-_DJEzZk2pc,Epic!
-_DJEzZk2pc,What if he ends up better then heath I didn‚Äôt think was possible but maybe.....
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The Joker
The villain we needed but not the villain we deserved"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Damn... i feel sorry for the Joker...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Who else  is playing Smile on repeat?
-_DJEzZk2pc,wow
-_DJEzZk2pc,...something ...makes me remind ...little anarchy....little ...do you want to know ...where i got these scars?... Ahh Letto. .ja..ja..ja..:V
-_DJEzZk2pc,MEH
-_DJEzZk2pc,Leave it to Phoenix to turn a franchise around. I can't believe I'm excited for a DC movie!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Just imagine if this was Jared Leto
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dude this looks so bad.
-_DJEzZk2pc,No I don‚Äôt want to feel bad for The Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,We will finally know how he got those scars.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why is this shit trending no1 instead of Blackpink ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Should God resurrect Heath Ledger to teach how to be a Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Was fhat Robert De Niro?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"One of the most iconic Villians of all time, How could they *POSSIBLY screw it up???*"

-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks pretty fuckin dope. Glad to see everyone agrees

-_DJEzZk2pc,Sigh... Fine.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why is DC trying to make a good movie? It's so weird.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why does this scare the shit out of me
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is gonna be a real Stanley steamer...
-_DJEzZk2pc,I wish they stuck to the comics I believe that‚Äôs why this movie won‚Äôt do well
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why so serious???? Wheres that iconic sentenceüòÇ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,What if the child behind the gates is bruce wayne??

-_DJEzZk2pc,so we live in a society
-_DJEzZk2pc,Okay interest insanely peaked!  Plus Joaquin had a lot of pain in his life. He can definitely use it in his character role as the The Joker!

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Finally.. it's been far too long between Jokers played well, Mark Hamill, Heath.. Beautiful and dark, torchered struggle, until all he could do was Laugh at Them... finally...."

-_DJEzZk2pc,He's not the joker we deserve. He's the joker we need.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The great thing about the Joker is that he has no reason to do what he does. He's a madman who does the most vile things. He has no weaknesses because he really just doesn't care about what happens to him. That's how Heath Ledger's Joker was. Joaquin Phoenix seems like the most dysfunctional out of all of them, though. He takes his madness as an art that comes naturally to him."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is the little kid young Bruce Wayne??? 1:51 and Bruce's father before the joker killed him ??? 1:44
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Not able to include any other DC Characters....pure stupidity.

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ok ok this is a dream come true ( ; 0 ; )üíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíúüíú

Joaquin Phoenix is too precious ahh I‚Äôm too happy what the hell man I can‚Äôt stop smiling‚ÄºÔ∏èüíõ

Edit : I think I broke the replay button xD"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ceasar Romano: A joke a day keeps the gloom away!
Jack Nicholson: Wait till they get a load of me.
Mark Hamill: You of all people should know,  there's plenty wrong with me. 
Heath Ledger: Why so serious?
Jared Leto: Oh, I'm not gonna kill you,  I'm just gonna hurt you. Really, really, bad.
Cameron Monaghan: You wanna know what the secret to good comedy is? Timing. 
Joaquin Phoenix: Put on a happy face.

Whether you love them or hate them, you have to admit that each joker had their own badass line."
-_DJEzZk2pc,He looked so happy when he was spinning the sign... only to be hit in the face with it later
-_DJEzZk2pc,This says a lot about our society üòé
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Damn dc, this actually seems interesting"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Pheonix = Joker
Scott adkins = Batman

This would make the perfect crossover movie. Imagine. Real batman fans üëá click the likes to let the producers see."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So the Joker is some Oedipal anti-hero? Um, no. He's an insane lunatic who does horrible things simply because it amuses him. Nothing more. Don't screw with that."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I was loving this trailer, and then I hear the same old nonsense about how ""Gotham has lost its way"". Ugh! f**k Gotham!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Isn't the joker made of chemicals? Wtf why can't he just have an one origin story
-_DJEzZk2pc,No Batman? No chemicals? No Harley Quinn? I don‚Äôt think so.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Chills!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I¬¥m shocked, fuck this seems awesome, october you look so far!!!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Feels just as if Heath Ledger is back :(  <3
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker will have 2 Oscars in his bag
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Mmmmm, ya no thanks"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"nope... if theres no damaged tattoo, silver grills, or gold chains Im out."
-_DJEzZk2pc,It looks like dc will make one more good movie after all
-_DJEzZk2pc,Holy Chat that trailer was awesome.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Before everyone loses their collective minds on the roles and whose better, remember each world they are in is a unique vision. Maybe this version is more relatable to the real world, even more relatable than Heath ledger's. (R.I.P) but ultimately each men in their own right is a legend as the joker... MAYYYBBBBEEE except the  Leto joker and it ain't even his fault. With that said this will be great because where Marvel lives to give us films that are more in touch with our imagination. DC tries when it comes to most of it's movies to be in touch with our reality."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dude I want to fucking watch this right now üò≠ it looks so good
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's like 'The Master' and 'You were never really here' combined.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Safe to say, he's overpassed Heath Ledger (and that was an almost impossible accomplishment)
The two best Jokers in cinema history"
-_DJEzZk2pc,‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüò±‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is a beautiful representation that you're sometimes the victim of your own environment. The Joker has always been known as a Nihilist and the Trailer shows you how he probably gave up on humanity and gave up on morality. So he embrace nihilism and treated reality as a satire. Life is a comedy.

If you want to see something similar while we all wait watch Taxi Driver with Rober de Niro. It shows how a man looses faith in society because of the decay amd rise of violence."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now that's a trailer ladies and gentlemen
-_DJEzZk2pc,What does it say @ 1:02 with the riddler question mark?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"DC, you don‚Äôt have a good track record"
-_DJEzZk2pc,That is the best trailer I have ever seen.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Excuse me, where are the fucking scars?  Will they come out together with movie or it will be in DLC? And what about pre-order?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is awesome
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This film is gonna do for the dc universe.. What zeppelin did for airships.. It looks so boooooring. Sit through the entire film... 5 mins of ""the joker"".. I'M SPENDIN MY MONEY ON SHAZAM"
-_DJEzZk2pc,It looks so good. I keep watching the trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,YES!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,You just got me feelin bad for him
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:51 Anyone else thinking the boy is Bruce Wayne?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This movie is going to be the biggest one this decade. Fuck Avengers, this is going to surpass it."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think this movie is going to be really good but Heath Ledger was the best joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Definitely the right actor to play Joker,this will be awesome!!! Can‚Äôt wait!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I dont know anything about much, but I do know that he'll be a good joker. I like cheese"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I miss heath ledger. Irreplaceable.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I like itüíñüíñ it's obvious that's gonna be a great movieüñíüëåüëå‚ù§üíôüíö
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is WB apology for copying the MCU with the DCEU and doing their own thing now.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Cool
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks so stupid. Wish they would've picked a better actor
-_DJEzZk2pc,WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think I‚Äôll skip this one üò™
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Reminds me of ""A Clockwork Orange"", if too young to know what that is, i recommend it highly."
-_DJEzZk2pc,So...what‚Äôs it about?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker is basically what would exist if every bad thing in Gotham was combined with a clown
-_DJEzZk2pc,Cant wait to see him say the N word
-_DJEzZk2pc,Better watch out for DC.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope he says ‚Äú we live in a society at least once‚Äù
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""All it takes is one bad day"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please please be an awesome movie please

-_DJEzZk2pc,I've never been more sympathetic towards the Joker before...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Today is actually Heath ledgers birthday and mine so in memory of Heath?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix his laugh is terrifying he's gonna on the wall of the jokers along side jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,October? I might die till then...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Movie looks interesting but that trailer is absolute garbage.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I miss the other joker üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ nooooooooo come back
-_DJEzZk2pc,$10 says this movie will be R-rated.
-_DJEzZk2pc,*I don't know if this story would be great. I don't know if it will live up to the hype. But I do know that Joaquin Phoenix will make a better Joker than Jared Leto.*
-_DJEzZk2pc,Best gift on my birthday‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüéâ
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Typical DC, Dark Very Dark... Dark Comics....
I like this..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I loved Jared Leto... man! I wish they would have developed him more before changing out the Jokers.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Move aside Marvel
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oscar for the best trailer üëçüèº
-_DJEzZk2pc,man recien me doy clients que es Chico de se√±ales
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow !
-_DJEzZk2pc,This says a lot about our society gamers rise up
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I get the feeling this trailer was trying to make me NOT go see the movie. I mean seriously, wtf was that??!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,He better be crazier than Patrick Bateman
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is it, chief."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Finally DC makes something good! It has been some time now...
 And Joaquin is nailing it, holy shit, Im unexpectedly excited for this! Took me by surprise"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This film is going to rock, Joker is the best"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I think this will be a bad movie, because in batman the dark knight joker tells stories about him self when he was a little kid before he got evil. But the trailer dont show any connection with the stories he told.

I think that makes it harder to love joker for who he really is."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath would be so proud
-_DJEzZk2pc,WOW. Alright DC this is your one shot....I really really really hope this is going to be good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:35 I thought that was Batman's voice.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oof finally a serious movie from DC again. Have been waiting since Batman Dark Knight trilogy.
-_DJEzZk2pc,s o c i e t y  t i m e
-_DJEzZk2pc,"He is like this weird yet perfect mixture of romero, nicholson, and ledger"
-_DJEzZk2pc,we wanna see joker killing motherfuckers not being knocked out and just laughing on 2 scenes. this movie is trash. joker is more badass than a 35kg schizophrenic human being.
-_DJEzZk2pc,that don't even look like the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:09 what a phenomenal actor :)
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Oh man this looks incredible, can't wait!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fucking A
-_DJEzZk2pc,Idk chief
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I hate that everyone hates him just for doing what he‚Äôs supposed to do he was doing his job then he was just laughing, WHATS THE PROBLEM WITH SHOWING EMOTION. I hate that but this movie looks really good, also when he was chasing the people that stole his sign then hit him with it, i actually felt sympathy for a villain I love the trailer tho.üÉèüÉèüÉèüÉèüÉèüÉè"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""I used to think my life was a tragedy... 

...But now I realize it's a comedy""


10/10 joker confirmed"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Don't know why but something is just telling me that he inspires the ""real"" Joker that ends up fighting Batman. And this Joker kills Bruce Wayne's parents. Just a feeling."
-_DJEzZk2pc,well fuck
-_DJEzZk2pc,Society makes it's own monsters.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"About time, we need more about JOKER! Everyone‚Äôs Halloween costume for this year for sure! ‚ù§Ô∏èüëçüèΩüòØüëèüèΩ"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why is this bum getting a movie before I do?
-_DJEzZk2pc,es mi imaginacion . es que veo a meryl streep como madre del joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Is it true that this is R rated?


I would love it if this is R rated."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Sometimes its nicr to see the changes that make and individual stronger or mad cause of trash society ,  cause usually they break"
-_DJEzZk2pc,DOINK THE CLOWN HAS RETURN
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is going to be hard and awkward to watch, but in the good way"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I liked the trailer , the world is getting tired of the super fights and wants more heroes/villains that are relatable"
-_DJEzZk2pc,0:50 that gun lean though
-_DJEzZk2pc,2:15 whoaaaa!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"king of comedy hugely inspired this film...that much is sure, the i used to think of my life....that line is taken from the movie king of comedy....and also many other similarities can been seen in this trailer, even joker's gf or girl he's seen with looks like rita from king of comedy"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Que diferencia, esta genial."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I love origin stories but I just hope it doesn't take too long into the film before we see him as the full blown Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I know I should not complain but I hope there will be a day where Jim Carrey gets a Joker role‚Ä¶..this one could've been it
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Oh boy.... this is definitely going to be a great DC movie!
I also love how the Joker is turned into the joker by society instead of some chemical accident."
-_DJEzZk2pc,THIS SHITS SO GOOD DUDE WTF üòÆüòÆ
-_DJEzZk2pc,State of the art.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I thought it would be a failure, but then...This trailer is scary! I want to watch it for sure! LOL"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Does anyone know if this is gonna be pg18
-_DJEzZk2pc,This look and is gonna be garbageüò§
-_DJEzZk2pc,been a while since I've looked forward to a DC movie - this actually looks interesting
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel bad for him I am scared of clowns tho
-_DJEzZk2pc,Watching this trailer in a repeat mode
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this movie in the same universe as DCEU?I hope not..
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yo now i actually think there is a little hope for DC. Now they can make up for the shitty excuse of the Joker from Suicide Squad.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Shit there's a batman game that's supposed to come out that month
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gotta love how people are so looking forward to seeing a sadistic killer but then become sad when it happens in real life. We are so f**ked. hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha. Good laugh.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Damn, this looks good :o"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"...For once, I am genuinely excited to see a DC Movie since Wonder Woman. It's so different and not trying to be Marvel or even DC, but its own thing."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks amazing and like exactly what DC should do but I have one question. Where does this fit in the DCEU. Because honestly I would like them to start it over because nobody knows how to make a good super hero movie besides the one who made Wonder Woman
-_DJEzZk2pc,I cannot wait
-_DJEzZk2pc,The Venom of the DC universe. Yawn. Feels more like Death To Smoochy.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow. From the trailer, this looks like this could be amazing, but yet again, people said the same about suicide squad..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,so one more thing i see another superstar taking the oscar bcz of joker here we go
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I absolutely love the fact that they didn‚Äôt go with the whole falling into a vat of chemicals and focussed on the one bad day origin, I can‚Äôt wait for this"

-_DJEzZk2pc,"In this new origin story, Joker will begin his path to villainy after falling into a radioactive vat of Society"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Did anyone notice how there‚Äôs no WB logo in this trailer, only DC?? Is this like a solo DC studios kinda thing? I mean I know DC is kinda owned by WB but like it‚Äôs still kinda interesting. Thoughts???"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Somehow Heath Ledger's portrayal still feels better... I love Joaquin but damn Ledger was entertaining.

Excited for it."

maybe he finally gets an Oscar."
-_DJEzZk2pc,RISE UP

-_DJEzZk2pc,The moment I heard the left hates this movie I wanted to watch it
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It‚Äôs probably not, but that looks like the set of stairs from ‚ÄòThe Exorcist.‚Äô"

-_DJEzZk2pc,I see Another Oscar winner!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,They better include the song Mercenary by Panic! at The Disco from one of the batman games in this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not even gonna lie it looks wack lowkey. Not getting the joker vibe off of it
-_DJEzZk2pc,"There is obviously a heavy undertone of mental illness here... What kind of mental illness is associated with the Joker falling into a fetal position and suckling, as if breastfeeding at 0:38 ?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I really hope they add as much gore and violence as they want to this and do what ever is needed to show the true darkness of the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Well this looks like it's going to be an absolute shit show of a waste of time.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Who write this?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Happy Birthday Heath Ledger! 
RIP :("
-_DJEzZk2pc,Atlanta stars getting some love
-_DJEzZk2pc,When Batman fails to save DCU... They call the Joker.

-_DJEzZk2pc,Only thing I find odd is for the first time his name starts in A(rthur) instead of the usual J
-_DJEzZk2pc,The kid that the Joker makes smile through the gate at 1:51 has got to be a young Bruce Wayne.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"the only time I got so impressed by a trailer was with LOGAN. This is sick. Dramatic, complex, aesthetically dense. At least the trailer looks great!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"DC releases Shazam: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre copying marvel with the humor‚Äù

seems oddly familiar...."

-_DJEzZk2pc,Someone please give this man an oscar
-_DJEzZk2pc,that nose on purple suit joker ugly as fuck lmao get rid off it
-_DJEzZk2pc,Steering that ship back in the right direction. I have no doubt that this is the start of the new DC universe. Joker opens the door for the Dark Knights return.
-_DJEzZk2pc,that laugher
-_DJEzZk2pc,Don‚Äôt worry. The joker will be rebooted 6 months from now....with someone new. My guess it will be Eddie Murphy playing the part.

Yes please."
-_DJEzZk2pc,It looks almost too creepy to watch but he‚Äôs an amazing actor to bring this origin story to life. Seems like a raw way to tell a story. I mean it really brings a core understanding of the human condition.  And what it‚Äôs capable of

-_DJEzZk2pc,"unpopular opinion, this movie looks god awful"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ledger is the best joker... Joaquin the second best
-_DJEzZk2pc,this is going to be epic...  üòò
-_DJEzZk2pc,What the song?

-_DJEzZk2pc,"I would of like the joker from sucide squad but no, we have to keep switching"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks boring.
-_DJEzZk2pc,lol this could be dcs first good movie in 2017 through 2019
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope they don't turn him into Robin hood
-_DJEzZk2pc,Jesus Christ this is legendary....
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Good trailer, need to wait for the full movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is gonna be awesome , that emotional depth only DC can provide"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So, they have a problem with Johnny Depp being too old to con't Pirates but they throw in an old joker. Phoenix is better off as Cash."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath Ledger was best
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I've no idea what this is, but it looks kinda good? I don't know how to live in this world anymore"
-_DJEzZk2pc,He might end up doing just as good as heath ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,what if everyone is capable to play the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix is going to show SJW Brie Larson what acting is all about!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think Joaquin Phoenix is gonna kill this
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Spokesperson: How can someone do something so cold blooded behind a mask?

Joker: *throws away the mask*
Spokesperson: oh"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is going to be a good movie! I can tell, who knows it may be terrible but it looks really good. Excited for this one."
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC Dark. It looks like he has some ‚ÄúOther‚Äù relationship with his mother. Bet you this movie will not be better than Joker Rising.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow Johny cash got epically dark.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh god i miss heath ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,Apesta a oscar
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker - the killing joke üòç
-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôm sure the acting will be fantastic but I don‚Äôt like the idea of joker being reduced to a typical ‚Äúman turned villain by societies ills‚Äù. I prefer joker without an origin story.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"People makes villains some become evil because they‚Äôre being treated like shit all their lives ,and their only way to not get hurt anymore is putting a mask on ,so here the joker is a villain created by this rotten world ."
-_DJEzZk2pc,a joker movie without batman...hmm
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gonna be Good
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wish Gary Oldman could play this role.
-_DJEzZk2pc,the oscar winner...!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Does anyone know if he will be in upcoming batman movies?
-_DJEzZk2pc,üòçüòçüòçüòç
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I think the movie is gonna be rubbish. Batman vs superman trailer looked astonishing but the movie itself was a big let down. This one is  directed by the guy who made ""The hangover"" so don't expect an oscar winning Christopher nolan type of movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why so Serious? Let's put a smile on your face.
-_DJEzZk2pc,His joker feels so unique
-_DJEzZk2pc,God please don‚Äôt make it flop!! üò≠
-_DJEzZk2pc,UN LIKE
-_DJEzZk2pc,A GOOD JOKER?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Motherfuckers stop comparing and fighting!!
It's just a damn movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,His Laugh is so good!
-_DJEzZk2pc,0:14 dat GTA shot though
-_DJEzZk2pc,I Can¬¥t Wait.
-_DJEzZk2pc,He will overtake Ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie doesn‚Äôt need cgi to get an Oscar! üòç
-_DJEzZk2pc,CHILLS! I love it!
-_DJEzZk2pc,That laugh though...
-_DJEzZk2pc,If the joker was in real life this would be him LOVE IT
-_DJEzZk2pc,I was skeptical of the casting at first but now I see why he‚Äôs practically perfect
-_DJEzZk2pc,"gotham created the joker , gotham deserves the joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Well bye infinity war
-_DJEzZk2pc,October looks so far
-_DJEzZk2pc,i thought his name was jack napier. but the dr calls him arthur
-_DJEzZk2pc,i dont wann start a rumble.. and i dont wanna compare them.. but.. that looks like a worthy Heath Ledger opponent
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This can be the game changer for DC ,DC should stick to what it's better at- darker movies.  what a wonderful trailer  ."
-_DJEzZk2pc,amazing
-_DJEzZk2pc,fuck ss2 this is the new shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:21 I think it's weirder that he doesn't  sit down and he's stopping on the subway being all empty
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:51 a young Bruce Wayne
-_DJEzZk2pc,Remember how hyped you were about suicide squad? Never forget...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"What is this!? This doesn't come even close to what i was expecting!!!

GOSH DO I LOVE IT!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,So now they got the actor right for Joker. Why did they release suicide squad?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This could  be amazing or terrible, but given DC's track record and the fact that it looks like they're giving the joker a set in stone back story, it's probably gunna be terrible"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks amazing. I know I'm going to cry. 38 year old man.
-_DJEzZk2pc,is that Robert De Niro 2:00 ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,name of the song????
-_DJEzZk2pc,We live in a society. Gamers rise up!
-_DJEzZk2pc,A masterpiece makeup... Waiting to see this epic.
-_DJEzZk2pc,wtf this is perfect i can't its scary af üò≠
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Holy shi...ft, DC! Aquaman, then Shazam, and just when we all thought you were becoming more family friendly you release this bomb?! I can't wait! I mean, I've just watched the Dark Knight a couple times because it really hits you in the stomach, and this one just looks way beyond that"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I believe Joaquin will reprise Heath's role. This feels like an amazing performance worth seeing!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I know they said this is separate but my this world looks so interesting to see Batman be a part of
-_DJEzZk2pc,That little smile at the end.‚ù§
-_DJEzZk2pc,Missed the greatest part... WHY SO SERIOUS ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please be good! Dear god please be good!
-_DJEzZk2pc,And the Oscar goes to..üëå
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel so sad for the joker in this trailer üò≠üò≠
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gooooooooooooood
-_DJEzZk2pc,This brie is called acting...
-_DJEzZk2pc,The backstory we need but the backstory we don‚Äôt deserve
-_DJEzZk2pc,"All it takes, is just one bad day."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This about to be sooooo goooooddddd
-_DJEzZk2pc,"this is my fakkin DC... ""DARK COMEDY"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ledger was a really well played psychopath in a joker outfit, this appears to be an outright psychopathilogical joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,oh its that guy
-_DJEzZk2pc,Omg I can‚Äôt fucking wait man
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is there no other villain in Gotham? Stop making damn joker movies trying to sell dark edgy psychological thrillers. Have they learnt nothing from their previous dark and edgy justice league mess?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Today is Heath ledger's birthday!!! 


RIP!! no one can replace you!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow, putain de fuckin' good trailerüòÆ... L' attente va √™tre interminable. 
J'esp√®re que le film sera √† la hauteur de ce que je viens de voirüò±"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel like this could be a classic or a total flop
-_DJEzZk2pc,RiSe uP GaMeRs
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:02 when you don‚Äôt get what you want for Christmas
-_DJEzZk2pc,Holy crap! This trailer is already better than the entire Jared performance!
-_DJEzZk2pc,0:14 He walks like me lol
-_DJEzZk2pc,I love the introspective vibe I get from this. Reminiscent of taxi driver with the locations too
-_DJEzZk2pc,"His laugh is ON FUCKING POINT

His makeup...ON FKG POINT

Thank you for the bottom of my hearth Mr. Phoenix"

-_DJEzZk2pc,YES..this loooks good.. finaly no more DC crappy CGI edgy nonsense for teens..
-_DJEzZk2pc,I see Joaquin Phoenix nominated for oscars already :D
-_DJEzZk2pc,So is this movie about how the joker became the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:02 when you receive anal for the first time
-_DJEzZk2pc,My my... the trailer itself has made a profound effect on me... never seen joequin transform himself so much for a movie... this is gonna be a movie of his lifetime...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"In the past you had to throw a man into chemicals, and he would turn into the Joker, now just throw a man into society and he'll become the Joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wasn't the Jokers real name Jack Napier
-_DJEzZk2pc,Its time to kick the Heath Ledger performance of the throne.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Bruce Wayne at 1:52ü¶á
-_DJEzZk2pc,his face at 1:13/14 is frightening
-_DJEzZk2pc,Welcome to the Russian
-_DJEzZk2pc,How ironic he is approaching the hospital he blows up in Batman
-_DJEzZk2pc,It looks like a film about a random clown and not the joker. I want to see more in the trailer and if there is not more good stuff then this film is gonna be trash lol
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why I didn‚Äôt understand anything from this trailer?
-_DJEzZk2pc,So what happens with jarret leto now?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Waiting for this
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Anyone knows the name of the song? 


This looks fucking amazing btw."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm seeing this shit a week after it drops, I'm sure some crazy white dude's gonna shoot up one of the theaters dressed as Black Mask or some shit. Lol"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If they can pull off the feel of the trailer this will be great, idk if I trust the DCU to do it."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This might actually be good. I was not expecting that.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I thinks he is too old to begin to become the joker.. the criminal masterminds persona must have built at earlier age like highschool age at least idk..
-_DJEzZk2pc,R.I.P HEATH
-_DJEzZk2pc,I get a feeling its not gonna be as DC as we hope. It might be as DC as Halle Berrys Catwoman
-_DJEzZk2pc,One bad day...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Anyone knows the song?
-_DJEzZk2pc,More comic garbage.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"DC should double down on some dark and great acting, instead of copying Marvel's cheesy jokes and humor."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I need to stop watching this .........I have watched this trailer for 10th times......
-_DJEzZk2pc,Perfect joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,The joker only with make up? Or make he himself a smile like in the comics?
-_DJEzZk2pc,This could quite possibly be the second time an actor wins an academy award for playing the Joker...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is what *society* causes...
Think about it..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,So how long before Joaquin Phoenix kills himself?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally a good live DC movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"1:08
you're welcome"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oscar winning material right here
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""Why are poor people confused? Because the don't make any cents"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks like an actual damn movie and not a comic book movie for manchildren. I‚Äôm impressed. I think this will be the first DC/Marvel movie to rival The Dark Knight
-_DJEzZk2pc,All it takes is one bad day.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow can't wait!!! Nuff said..
-_DJEzZk2pc,Time to restart DC!
-_DJEzZk2pc,i'm routing for him to violently kill all the people that wronged him in the trailer is that normal?
-_DJEzZk2pc,He'll do justice to Heath and Jack Nicholson
-_DJEzZk2pc,"*looks boring, whiny and shit. Should've called it The Wimp*"
-_DJEzZk2pc,...meh.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I used to think that my life was a tragedy, Now I realise it's a comedy! DAMMMM IMBURNINGGGGGG"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Even the Joker loved his mother
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like IT
-_DJEzZk2pc,Love him!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wait...so how old is the Joker in this universe? The guy looks in his 40s. if Bruce Wayne is just a little kid here, then the guy is going to be an elderly old man by the time Bruce Wayne becomes Batman.

Edit: Also, ""The worst part about having a mental illness is that people expect you to behave as if you don't."" Ooof...That... actually hurts."
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:08 that's creepy...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Will it finally show how he got those scars??
-_DJEzZk2pc,This trailer is perfect. It doesn't give away anything yet it make us so much more hyped
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks horrible
-_DJEzZk2pc,"My heart is broken when the bastards took the sign and hurts him, you can see when he played with it he has a genuine smile, he's happy, but the world is a cruel place that it is even the nicest man got a taste of evil, this is not a story about how he become devil. But a journey about world made him become one.

world has become more crazier indeed"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Omg  this looks amazing! üòç
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fuck man I got Chills on this! I was watching the trailer at 2AM and fucking 5 degree scale weather. Damn lets go!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,if you have not yet done this.. pause the video at about 27 seconds in and read the notebook hes writing in
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can feel it!
-_DJEzZk2pc,fight club
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks amazing. No matter what people says leto's version is great and this one is too. There is so many Jokers and room gor everyone.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks unbelievably good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Gamers Rise Up
We live in a society"
-_DJEzZk2pc,The reveal at 2:22
-_DJEzZk2pc,This keeps getting more and more interesting each time I watch it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"As I recall, his own dad made him ‚Äúsmile scar‚Äù right? From ear to ear."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks dumb
-_DJEzZk2pc,take away the makeup and this is like 60% of the homeless people walking around san diego...
-_DJEzZk2pc,This film is gonna be more than just a film about The Joker. This is gonna be an artistic inside look on the fall of man after he‚Äôs been beaten up by the world around him.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Who all here have watched the trailer more than 50 times now...

The more I watch, the more I feel the depth of the character.... Even his laugh expresses so many emotions..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,A good DC movie? HELL YEAH !! Looks like it's gonna be great
-_DJEzZk2pc,High hopes for this flick
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This could, potentially, be the best comicbook movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Im here for psychological dark villian movies Dc you know this is your shit!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix better not die. Look after him pls
-_DJEzZk2pc,Alright this looks good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This trailer makes me feel an unexplainable type of sad
-_DJEzZk2pc,Everyone is gangsta until this guy enters sicko mode
-_DJEzZk2pc,Music name ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,HO LY SHIT HO LY SHIT
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's gonna be a Masterpiece !
-_DJEzZk2pc,If this takes place in the 80's could that little kid by the gate be Bruce Wayne hmmmmm
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker is the greatest carecter on dark type....
-_DJEzZk2pc,SOOO MUCH BETTER THAN SHAZAM TELETABIES
-_DJEzZk2pc,0:47 Those arms.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"0:27 the last line he wrote really hit me, ""The worst part of having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you dont"" The whole trailer gave me chills and if this in depth character study can help bring to light the the issue of mental illness and the taboo label it seems to have in modern society then this is gonna be a masterpiece"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I feel this can go both ways. DC could make a great film that leaves the viewers stunned, shocked and unconfettable. Or this can be another lame predictable film. I hope it's the first, while the later may make more money at the box office - the only way anyone can top Heath's performance is to make the audience identify with this truly disturbed character."
-_DJEzZk2pc,holy shit this is dark
-_DJEzZk2pc,Merinding
-_DJEzZk2pc,#Joker #WatchTheWorldBurn
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks interesting. I'm a bit excited to see it. ü§©
-_DJEzZk2pc,they screw over the joker in every rendition minus ledger who actually brought the joker to life

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Its so Hollywood Cliche..
Every badass villain has a sweet momma story & a bullied life."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Awful. DC will ruin this like everything else.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath ledgers birthday near release date hmm
-_DJEzZk2pc,That movie stands and falls with Phoenix's performance. I can't wait to see it though.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"From the looks of the trailer, it could be that the man giving speech on the television is Bruce Wayne's father and the joker just killed him and while attending the funeral, joker forces a smile upon Bruce Wayne's face from the other side of the gate because he knew all it takes is a single day to turn a man insane. And all along we know that he knew Bruce is Batman. 
#Mjustsaying."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"the acting is amazing, i dont like the make up though. I prefer Ledgers smudged dirty look, over this clean psycho birthday clown. It's mostly the red nose and the blue color."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I will pay for this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,"why october,, i want to see it now"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is going to be good!.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm still not sure how I feel about this
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC you always got me...ü§ò
-_DJEzZk2pc,All I see is a DC rewrite of the Bates Motel.  Mamas boy gone psycho.  They should have done something more creative and have it narrated by Mark Hamill as if he was telling his own origin story.

-_DJEzZk2pc,"Before trailer: meh
After trailer: holy shit reeeeeeeeeeee"
-_DJEzZk2pc,How many number of actors playing joker are they going for?
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie trailer has reminiscence of taxi driver...
-_DJEzZk2pc,I wish they'd just sell the character rights to Disney already so that he can fight the Avengers
-_DJEzZk2pc,Are we abandoning Suicide Squad Joker now? Because I am DOUBLE hyped for this movie if so!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Man I really love movies and I can't stand this, it doesn't look like joker it doesn't even look like a good movie period, you guys are hating on alladin bug u should be hating on this, it just looks like a boring drama movie like the only cool thing that they said in this was that they said Gotham and that's it, go back to Jarod leto now that was amazing"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I haven‚Äôt been this excited for something in a long time.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don't want him to be Heath Ledger's joker... I just want him to be the joker that became Heath ledger's joker...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Damn this looks promising
-_DJEzZk2pc,The directing looks horrible - why did they hire the guy who directed Hangover? lol
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow, finally a good looking DC movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Are you kidding me this movie looks like a joke ! Who the hell cares about that stuff?! Just give us the joker and batman fighting . And for the love of god enough with the joker there are other villains too

-_DJEzZk2pc,DC sucks ass lmao
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This looks awesome but I don't think it's going to save DC.
*_The Dark Knight_* was awesome too, but it couldn't integrate, and so it was useless."
-_DJEzZk2pc,not sure if I'm gonna like this back story.... but the movie itself looks amazing!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie trailer has epic vibes....
-_DJEzZk2pc,This will be so bad
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:52 my prediction is that this is from the end of the movie and that kid is Bruce Wayne right after his parents get killed...
-_DJEzZk2pc,>tfw you finally take the honkpill
-_DJEzZk2pc,Well that was boring.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"IDK man, Joaquin Phoenix as Joker, his face just.. right. I feel he IS the Joker we need & we ask."

They select very bad actor for this terribblle movie.

They shit on jokerüò° 
Very bad movie.


We love  suicide squad's  joker

-_DJEzZk2pc,Its kinda creepy and sad too

-_DJEzZk2pc,Creepy and scary AF!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ronald McDonald, Origins"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is shit dude
-_DJEzZk2pc,RIP Heath Ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now this. Looks good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin looks so good in this I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm excited or disturbed
-_DJEzZk2pc,That man is a boss!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Im not a dc fan but this trailer just won my heart
-_DJEzZk2pc,"People expect to see a super hero movie, but DC made an art film. Any way, looking forward to see that movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"No one will ever out do Heath Ledgers joker, but i am 100% down to see this, it looks dope!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôve watched this an unhealthy amount of times lol
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Dont like superhero movies that much, but I want too see this movie. NOW!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can't wait to see this movie thank God it's not leto playing the joker I like this look it's similar to Heath and to see him go up to young Bruce and put a smile on is face is kinda crazy this movie is go to be bad ass
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie has already got me hook. I love the style of this story seeing a failure of a man descending into madness and eventually becoming a menace.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"‚ÄúLaugh clown, laugh. Even though your heart is breaking.‚Äù"
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:26 that laugh tho
-_DJEzZk2pc,OMG YESSS I CANT WAIT
-_DJEzZk2pc,the critiques were wrong. analysts were wrong. movie reviewers were wrong. everyone who thought DC had no scope were wrong. i am not a comic fan but DC is growing on me now. i am a mature adult with some darkness in me like anyone. world is not al flashy and colors like marvel universe. have to accept the fact that life is dark sometimes.
-_DJEzZk2pc,this looks boring AF!
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC is doing themselves some favors üëèüèªüëèüèª
-_DJEzZk2pc,So his crime was not all his fault......it was tragic
-_DJEzZk2pc,My expectations are even lower now for this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not funny at all. Not watching.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is just extraordinary
-_DJEzZk2pc,Still better than Jared Leto...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ledger for me was one of the best joker I ever seen and the other that followed just didn't stick but this one really seams promising 
He's not like ledger's and maybe it'll not be as good  to  some people but alone it's already a good and scary it  already  feels like Joker  to me and its all that matters"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So I have to wait until October, huh?üò≠Too longüò≠üò≠üò≠"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nigga Skinny Ass Fuck
-_DJEzZk2pc,This actually looks and sounds fucking sick
-_DJEzZk2pc,I am a die-hard joker fan
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:43 did he go on a crash diet for this role?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin is better than Jared.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This really says a lot about our society as a whole.
-_DJEzZk2pc,What an unattractive man.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I am not sure whether it's a good idea to make movies for adults about characters written for children.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like he has a very odd relationship with his mother.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Its just not making any sense to me
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks amazing.  Hope they don't fuck it up like usual.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"That‚Äôs definitely Bruce, but the age gap is a little startling. That‚Äôs at least 30 years. Unless this joker gets some sort of meta bump. I‚Äôm interesting in seeing where they take this."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Are we gonna ignore the fact that the music in this trailer, is fucking amazing ?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If he were to be an anti hero, this character would hands down be the best."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"im excited for this... one of my favorite points about the joker is that he's supposed to represent how every person is ""just one bad day"" away from becoming a monster... this will be cool!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,arguably the best trailer ive seen
-_DJEzZk2pc,For me this trailer is already the proof for the Jokers behavior in dark knight. He‚Äôs done with the world and only wants to create chaos
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Phinex is One of the best if not the best actor. He is so good ans he is a methode actor. His joker will be fantastic.

But i am not sure if the story, The editing, the director and thr film crew are going to do half as good as mr J. Phinex.

I am afraid despite the actor's efforts this is going to be a mediocre film. God i hope i am wrong."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"hands up,the best joker right now"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"...but life is a comedy """
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:51 batman.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This trailer is basically:
Joker: Everybody acting so funny, but not to worry, i'm about to act hilarious"
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:43 he is skinny af!
-_DJEzZk2pc,that laugh at 1:08 gives me chills
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks kind of lame
-_DJEzZk2pc,*HE IS GONNA SAY THE N WORD!!! EVERYBODY GET DOWN!!!!*
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix and Heath Ledger will go down as the absolute best Jokers off all time. The young and the old.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If people are right and that's young bruce Wayne, that would mean that batman isn't in this. The Joker cant work without batman. I expected this to be a Batman vs. Joker story but from the point of view of the Joker, instead it will be a goddam origin movie... because everybody loves the origin stories in comic-book movies, they aren't annoying and unnecessary at all...."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Omg :(
-_DJEzZk2pc,"HOLY SHIT,  finally a movie to watch instead of that dumbass Aladdin movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,why the hell did they put this guy as the joker?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think DC screwed enough superheroes movies that they decided to do villains.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Pagliacci meets Falling Down. I'd watch that. But it better have Joe Davola in it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Darker and darker and darker we go, where it stops, nobody knows"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Perfect...and  Batman from Frank Miller  ...cant wait
-_DJEzZk2pc,This actuallly looks bad..Not making me smile Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,No one can do better than RIP Heath ledger my Favourite DC villain but Hero for everyone. The best actor for the film Joker is RIP Heath ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,"WHY JOACHIM PHOENIX, AND NOT JIM CAREY???"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ohhhhh Yea!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,flop
-_DJEzZk2pc,Paper Boi ü§î
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks fucking dope.
-_DJEzZk2pc,It will be a legend

-_DJEzZk2pc,Creepy
-_DJEzZk2pc,https://youtu.be/8DBzUNnIutw osm sir really good trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,https://youtu.be/8DBzUNnIutw osm sir really good trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,https://youtu.be/8DBzUNnIutw osm sir really good trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can't see this movie without heath ladger
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Finally. Just what I was expecting. A perfect darkness, and not another typical ""superhero"" glossed over look. This is what a villain movie should look like. Been waiting for this for a long time. Some realism, some humanity. A story of a man that just wants to ""be"" and live, but loses his way. You cannot go wrong with Joaquin Phoenix, that guy is a true artist at his craft.

 More human tragedy over action. Yes please."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"don't create expectations, don't create expectations.....too late"
-_DJEzZk2pc,From the beginning I always said there are only two options to interpret the joker perfectly: Daniel Day Lewis and Joaquin Phoenix. And there you are!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Okay, now I‚Äôm hooked."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin Phoenix is one of the most talented actors around today IMO and one of a very select few who could continue this role respectfully after Heath Ledger's masterpiece. Good call DC, lets hope the rest of the team are up to the task because this has the potential to be a classic. Great trailer."
-_DJEzZk2pc,That‚Äôs a good laugh!
-_DJEzZk2pc,ITS OBVIOUS THE PLOT IS GOING TO ROTATE AROUND A GOOD GUY WHOSE GOING BAD
-_DJEzZk2pc,Let's put a smile on that face
-_DJEzZk2pc,chills
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yeah!after so many years finally dc put something good on the table...at least i hope so...my only question is...and batman?!?!
-_DJEzZk2pc,its gonna be the worst movie ever in history and i dont even know why i watched this trailer ITS FORKING BULLSHIRT
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think this film is sort of leaning towards a political side like they tried in BvS. Maybe now they‚Äôll know how to make this good. This could honestly be the best Joker yet
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks way too pretentious. I'm out.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin Phoenix is ‚Äã‚Äãthe only one from school 90 who can rival Heath Ledger.

Without a doubt, a very high level.
üé≠üé≠üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè."
-_DJEzZk2pc,when you shit yourself
-_DJEzZk2pc,wow visually speaking that actor is perfect for the role
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I like the slim frail bony look. It's getting old seeing all these super ripped ppl or supermodel bodies in movies, its unrealistic and not how the average person looks."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Incel doomer joker tries looksmaxing
-_DJEzZk2pc,That's a great laugh
-_DJEzZk2pc,Another DC  flop show
-_DJEzZk2pc,I smell  Oscar  over there
-_DJEzZk2pc,The jonker is made by soceity only because yuo and me have made it bad to live in and now he is going for yuo and me because he sees that we are the real monsters this will be eic to see how jocker does his clowning around only to make people realize this is the world we live in and it is funny when yuo see it. Think about it
-_DJEzZk2pc,"try watching the trailer and play David Bowie's ""Space Oddity""."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I am trying to imagine this trailer with a song of Radiohead, something like You And Whose Army or Man Of War..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm into it
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Just no.
Fails to capture my attention at all... In fact, it comes across as something I probably won't even watch for free, one it hits Netflix, HBO, or whatever.
Sorry."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It has to be a sad story, it just has to be! Make the audience feel sad for him almost to the point of making us cry! That way when he turns insane the audience will love him justifying that it was the right thing to do. If that happens then the audience will have turned crazy loving an insane villian, that way joker wins making everyone insane."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now yuo see the funny side...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally
-_DJEzZk2pc,This whole movie is a cautionary tale about fucking with people!! Lol I love it!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Imagine if Jared Leto starred instead lols
-_DJEzZk2pc,I lik dis....
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Omg, dont be too good, Disney will buy it and scrap it."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I would love to see heath ledger in this role
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hisoka is real :)
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I don‚Äôt care what anyone says but DC characters has the best heroes and Villains than the Marvel Universe.
Marvel may still have the best movies 
Christopher Nolan did a great job for Batman 
But I see that DC films has improved since ‚ÄúAquaman‚Äù and this ‚ÄúJoker‚Äù film will be a epic one that will make Thanos cry like a little girl."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"CHILLS BRO, CHILLS"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"There are some people who genuinely should not see this. I‚Äôm not saying it glorifies mental illness, but it definitely comes close..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,The Joker finally gets a back story and it takes place in an episode of Atlanta!? üò≠üî•
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow!!!
I never knew joker was bullied"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I NEED BATMAN IN THIS MOVIE
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I feel bad for the joker at the beggining of the trailer bc you see he just wanted to bring joy to the world and there are people who are jerks to them and maybe the possible death of his mother will be the detonator after having a horrible day which will lead to him becoming the joker... as the joker himself said. ""It only takes one bad day"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I wonder if the joker is going to start rambling about, ""The industrial society"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,Something with his eyes...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like they are using the ONE BAD DAY monologue as the inspiration here.
-_DJEzZk2pc,someone tell me what the piano track in the trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,"i can tell already its garbage, just like all except heath ledger"
-_DJEzZk2pc,hope they won‚Äôt fuck it up
-_DJEzZk2pc,"people are the one who made him mad, so, people are crazy not him"

-_DJEzZk2pc,Now I think the kid he makes smile (creepily) is young Bruce???
-_DJEzZk2pc,Bad boy bubby vibes..
-_DJEzZk2pc,jared leto who?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix is a perfect fit for this!  THIS IS HOW YOU ACT Brie Larsen.... Take notes boo. #CaptainMarvelSucks
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Behold, The Joker...im happy he's back."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Man, this looks good. Entertaining cinema. Unique and creative take, I except that. And most will be entertained by it. On the contrary I sense a certain trend I find that makes me uneasy. The recent trend about how the left loves to highlight the enemy as a victim. Maybe it be true maybe it not. Such a thing going unchecked by reasonable figures in power is a dangerous thing. 10 years we might have Jokers all over the place."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"FINALLY, it looks like what dc should be"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I miss heath ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,This might redeem the DC Universe üôÄ. How oddly poetic it comes from it‚Äôs greatest villain and not it‚Äôs heroes.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The Music :O
-_DJEzZk2pc,Trash . So bad no one can play joker except heath ledger. He‚Äôs the only joker the best give it up DC you‚Äôre ass. The best Batman films were Batman begins and the dark knight.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks boring with no fight scenes
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Will he finally say ""we live in a society"" tho"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Somehow it reminds me of zach galifiannakis baskets... Not sure if its a good or bad thing
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So...anything that happens to him will Technically be considered ""Natural causes"". That's deep. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Everyone? ü§î"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Do I ask too much if I want a Joker like the one in the killing joke?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I still hate him for killing Maximus....damn him
-_DJEzZk2pc,üòç
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Amazing Joaquin Phoenix, give him an Oscar! He deserves it even for making the trailer only!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Petition to make Joaquin Phoenix's Joker the opposite of Gamer Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Phoenix looks convincing ..hope the movie will be also good
-_DJEzZk2pc,I have been desperate to see this film right up until I saw this trailer then I was like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll wait‚Äù
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""He is not a villain
Nor a hero
He just person
Dying because of world's cruelity"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,That thumbnail realy is a mood.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie is gay af it never gonna be the same as dark Knight and Batman 2000 but at the end there was a eater egg from one of our past joker's put a smile on your face why so serious
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oscar for Best Actor 2019
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can‚Äôt wait to see this makes me feel a tin of the heath ledger role
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:52 is this kid bruce wayne?
-_DJEzZk2pc,The Jokers interpretation of the Gotham Series should get a own spin off-movie!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,All it takes...is one bad day.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Meh
-_DJEzZk2pc,oscor for phoenix on its way!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:09 that laugh was creepy
-_DJEzZk2pc,I believe he can reach Ledger‚Äôs level but not over him.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow, I feel like I‚Äôm diving into the mind of the joker and seeing things through his eyes.  The joker has always been liked and now this has given it more reason to."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix = Magistral ;)
-_DJEzZk2pc,"one of the comments with many likes to it mentioned not liking the prospect of this movie cuz it doesn‚Äôt represent what the joker is meant to be; in the sense that identity of joker supposed to be unknown and parallel to batman‚Äôs ideology and so on. but i find this movie even better already the fact that you have people wearing the mask of joker, so it‚Äôs not just this one person doing something for his own good. This shows that original beginning of ‚Äòjoker‚Äô was represented by this main character we get here but his ‚Äòidea‚Äô began to expand and develop through the face of other ‚Äòjokers‚Äô coming up in public (which we will see in the movie)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,0:37 *THIS BITCH EMPTY*
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks fucking terrible
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Not too bad. Still, Dark Knight ruined Joker for me forever, it's always gonna be the measuring stick that others won't reach."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Funny thing the intro of the trailer (showing buildings) reminds me of the dark knight's intro
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is DC on the comeup??üòç
-_DJEzZk2pc,Are we supposed to have a soft corner for Joker after this? Joker was a great villain because his past of as mystery. Now it turns out that Gotham changed him to become  a bad person!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now THIS is a movie I‚Äôd pay to see. Take notes Brie Larson
-_DJEzZk2pc,i don't know but i keep repeating the 2:07 part it's so great
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix <3
-_DJEzZk2pc,We didn't  see movie yet so  please any one make Comparison between  him and joker darke night  go to hell and don't come  to watch
-_DJEzZk2pc,"You wanna know how he got those scars?

-_DJEzZk2pc,That laugh omg
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Good, we need another joker to wash the bad after taste of Jared Letto out of our mouths!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,looks mediocre and i dont like how its another origin story but we will see
-_DJEzZk2pc,I miss Heath Ledger- Best joker ever..
-_DJEzZk2pc,Are you serious DC? Are you going to make a masterpiece out of nowhere?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Never thought I'd see the day when Joker would become a sign dancer.
-_DJEzZk2pc,dang that's dark lmao
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This film looks great. Only thing that sucks is that it's independent of the DCU, much like how Venom is a Marvel movie but not connected to the MCU in any way. This means we'll most likely be seeing Leto reprise his role as Joker in future DCU films."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"OK, now i'm convinced. This might work."
-_DJEzZk2pc,After heith's portrayal of joker first time i connected with another  joker

-_DJEzZk2pc,No JOAQUIN PHOENIX Why not woody harrleson
-_DJEzZk2pc,Mark my words. It's going to be the best Joker of them all.

-_DJEzZk2pc,But WHY ?

1- why is the guy on the subway standing when there are many empty chairs around him>?
2- I wonder how will Jared Letto feel when he sees this trailer and realizes that he was and still the worst Joker everrr?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm just so glad you can actually see what's going on in this trailer... The movie doesn't look dark because of a lack of lighting, it looks dark because they're actually taking the villain character seriously."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Remind me a bit about taxi driver
-_DJEzZk2pc,It‚Äôs funny how the two best dc movies have the joker in them

-_DJEzZk2pc,"The master stroke that Marvel Cinematic Universe has that DC doesn't (or Fox with their XMen etc) is selecting the right person for the character to being it to life.
Then  keeping them in the role happy for a very long long time so that audiences have stability & consistency which comic books offered. 
This effectively brings the comic book hero to life and staying with the audience just like in the original comic book. 
Not having several people playing the same character with inconsistent interpretation or polarising interpretation. Just saying..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,The one who made this trailer is a genius.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Release date?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Just the trailer deserves an oscar

-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow
-_DJEzZk2pc,The actor is good actor but his voice is too soft for the role. Think they choose him because he kinda looks like heather ledger. The makeup artist should've gotten rid of the blue around the eyes to many bright colors.

-_DJEzZk2pc,"I really liked every big screen representation of the Joker so far. However, it looks as though they followed the same DC recipe of filming 90% of the movie in dim or dark lighting. Not a single second of that trailer makes me want to see it. I enjoy the comic movies, but this trailer does nothing for me. Looks like an art school's student's independent film. It doesn't help they chose a song written in 1936 with lyrics added in 1954."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"if i didn't already know who the joker was, this trailer would have been a random mess of things i wouldn't understand. why would i want to watch a movie about a failing clown?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Damn did I forgot count of how many times I watched this trailer or is it Joker playing with my mind.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please be good movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Lets just hope this doesnt kill him like it did to heath.
-_DJEzZk2pc,So which drug is this joker?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Goosebumps
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now we are supposed to feel bad for the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I cannot stop watching this!!!
""Is it just me or is it getting crazier out there""
Nope it's not just you mate"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks promising.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Pheonix is a helluva good actor, i honestly couldn't think of anybody to play this part better after heath ledger. The worlds greatest villain deserves some TLC."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Is this part of the DCEU? Coz if it is, u done good."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hi Im Horny
-_DJEzZk2pc,i smell OSCARS
-_DJEzZk2pc,love this trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,I..I just can't..stand this epicness.PHOENIX IS A GENIUS
-_DJEzZk2pc,This makes the Clown Prince Of Crime look like a tragic villain.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Young Bruce Wayne at 1.51
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gangweed rise up!
-_DJEzZk2pc,If Travis Bickle became the Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is kinda scary
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don‚Äôt think anyone in their right mind though they would see a better joker in their life time than Nicholson‚Äôs or Ledgers.............until now
-_DJEzZk2pc,New hero Âî§ÈÜí‰∫∫‰ª¨ÁöÑÂøÉ
-_DJEzZk2pc,The Joker is backkkk!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Seems to me like this joker has been hanging out with Hannibal lecter.... good combination apparently.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I might actually pay to see this one.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow....highly anticipated. Looks promising. The character that we all loved...is coming back with a bang.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Honestly the best representation of the joker. He seems more like a human here.
-_DJEzZk2pc,And the greatest potrayal of the Joker goes to...
-_DJEzZk2pc,How can a mad man become the gang leader of crime? Will the movie explain that?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dude his joker laugh is PERFECT doesnt look like hes even trying like leto did.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Madness is the emergency exit.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like the fucking DC has made it again ...
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope he kills the people who wronged him
-_DJEzZk2pc,I wish they can add this joker to the DCEU with WW84 since this movie is set to be in the 1980s
-_DJEzZk2pc,Y'ALL BETTER NOT FUCK THIS UP
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I hated the trailer.
 The reason joker was such a cool and mysterious character was because we didn't know the full story behind the charisma and charm.
This movie seems to just throw it all out there. 
I know supposed to be a sort of an origin movie but how does they expecme to connect and get sucked into the origin story if  I don't even know what this adaptation of the joker is like as the fully crazy clown he is bound to be?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Time to win your Oscar, Joaquin!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Batman left the conversation ‚úåü§£ü§£ü§£
-_DJEzZk2pc,So joker was kind of a tragic Villan who ended up being a nihilist Villan and now joker is the ultimate nihilist Villan and there's nothing tragic about him only reason of his existence is to bring chaos and death. This is so omnious and alluring and this trailer gave me the chills.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Fuck the Batman. Finally a stand alone Joker movie, STARRING JOAQUIN PHOENIX GADDEM"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks good, but they're milking this whole joker thing on all tits, soon it'll be a series."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Phoenix has done a great job transforming himself. He clearly isn't trying to impersonate any other jokers that preceded him. Loved that laugh too!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks better than it has any right to be. I‚Äôm super excited
-_DJEzZk2pc,Still...movie could be crap. But I ll be optimistic.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This Will Blow MCU
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow this looks stellar. I had a feeling Jaoquin Phoenix would deliver chills. Can't wait to see this
-_DJEzZk2pc,more hyped to this than the endgame
-_DJEzZk2pc,A sure watch ..
-_DJEzZk2pc,Once again gotham lost it's wayü§£
-_DJEzZk2pc,i wonder if he kills the studio audience
-_DJEzZk2pc,This will be a big boom for DC
-_DJEzZk2pc,Am i the only one that doesnt think it will be good even without comparing to Ledger?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sorry leto.. but this is how you play the joker my friend.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"No one can beat Heaths Joker, but damn, If anyone has a chance its Joaquin :-)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,And i was thinking that a joker without Heath is incomplete.....
-_DJEzZk2pc,"All I got from this is the joker not only can get beaten up by batman, but beaten up by EVERYBODY!. Looks better than I was expecting however."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin Phoenix is a godsend to the vegan world! He has produced and narrated vegan documentaries like ""Earthlings"". You guys must check it out. It's there on YouTube"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This doesn't even need the jokers name,it already looks like a solid movie about a clown that had his button pushed way too much."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I kinda felt bad for him tho. Arthur I mean. around 0:28 and 1:20 got me for some reason. Seeing Arthur, a grown man who isn't as rich struggling through life with his mother, getting bullied and beaten up just... I dunno. It makes this movie feel like it's gonna be amazing with all of that shit Arthur has been through used a fuel to power the joker into *MADNESS!* (which is just amazing)


*BUT DUDE!!!!!! THIS GENUINELY LOOKS PROMISING.*  *IT CAPTURES THE SAD PAST OF THE JOKER PERFECTLY!*"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wait for movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,it's going to be fall of sjw shit like all dc movies.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wasn't the whole appeal of the Joker that his background story was supposed to stay a mystery forever? And that it doesn't matter where he came from?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don't think this would be the jokers back story
-_DJEzZk2pc,Are we finally make to heath ledger level of joker?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
-_DJEzZk2pc,He is gonna get an Oscar
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this the dude from HER?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Give him the Oscar, now!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Am i the only one thats thinks this will be a dance movie like Showmaster, expected to see Hugh Jackman jumping out of a corner. No way this will git gud."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If I said it made me feel sad, scared, happy, excited, skeptical and uneasy would be an understatement. Heath ledger had his own take on joker and now it's Joaquin's turn."
-_DJEzZk2pc,why would anyone do such a thing to a clown ? ü§£üòÇüòÇü§£üòÇ
-_DJEzZk2pc,I want to skip this part and wait for Sequel when he rains chaos
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It must be a masterpiece ,  Love Joaquin so much"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Seems kinda shitty
-_DJEzZk2pc,Comedy in tragedy. Joker life motto
-_DJEzZk2pc,WTF!?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Remembered director Todd Phillips documentary called 'Hated : GG Allin & the Murder Junkies!  ;)
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is better than Captain Marvel
-_DJEzZk2pc,Thank you for not revealing the entire story :)
-_DJEzZk2pc,Cool but I wished he could‚Äôve at least donned the purple suit
-_DJEzZk2pc,Will we finally see a good D.C movie since dark knight trilogy ? damn i think we will xd.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Is It Just Me Or?
Does this feel like a set up to a very 2 & A Half hour  long movie? With the action delivered the last 20min of the Film? Setting up for a Batman from the 60's or 80's"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Just one bad day.....
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I hope he finds those kids who smashed him up with his sign and ruins them, please please please be a super dark movie! its about time for this kinda stuff."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I see this not going like I thought it might def thought it might be something like the dark night but it‚Äôs nothing going to be like that or have anything to do with Batman really don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll like it as much
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Finally, a movie exposing the depressing life of a gamer."
-_DJEzZk2pc,why does this remind me of that sexy vegan segment from Dr. Phil lol
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dark..... hahahahahahahaha
-_DJEzZk2pc,Let's all forget that horrible leto role now!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Okay.. this does look incredible, but What kind of joker movie wouldn‚Äôt have Batman? They complete each other!



Also, damn. Jared Leto is finally doing a great joker impersonation!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"No me siento muy animado a ver como el villano misterioso desaparece....siempre he sido fan del c√≥mic de Batman, en mi opini√≥n el m√°s genial por los conflictos psicol√≥gicos que ah√≠ se ventilan, y el Joker siempre me pareci√≥ el villano perfecto, nadie sabe de donde viene, qui√©n es, porque de su locura y su terror√≠fica maldad al carecer de sentido, prop√≥sito o ""causa""....s√© que es fantas√≠a, solo historias para divertir y entretener, pero no necesito en lo personal que ""humanisen"" al mejor villano de DC, que causen simpat√≠as innecesarias hacia √©l o muchos digan: aaaah con raz√≥n...prefiero quedarme siempre con la duda de tan incre√≠ble y misterioso villano, espejo de la locura de Bruce Wayne y casi su nemesis perfecto....s√≥lo mi opini√≥n...."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Creepy.....I LOVE IT!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Something about this reminds me of Scorsese‚Äôs Taxi Driver.
-_DJEzZk2pc,0:12 and 2:12
-_DJEzZk2pc,I have faith in Phoenix. He's gonna deliver a performance one cant forget.
-_DJEzZk2pc,IM SO FUCKING HYPED UPPPPPPPPPP
-_DJEzZk2pc,I want Jared Leto as Joker. This is a big disappointmet
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I guess Im the only one who is not overly excited for this?
I love the joker as a villan but this trailer didnt make me want to see it."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I‚Äôve probably watched this thirty times today. The soundtrack, the feeling of a man gone through tragedy, feeling misunderstood through mental health and finally snapping and letting out and giving the people what they think a mentally ill person acts like. I can not WAIT to see Joaquin knock this out of the park"
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC movies should only exist in that 1900-1960 New York type of look. It cannot be modernized. This looks amazing.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ledgers 40th birthday on the release day of the trailer. Coincidence? i think not.
-_DJEzZk2pc,ooh man this is like watching a trailer about Travis Bickle getting slowly possesed by the Pennywise entity
-_DJEzZk2pc,"DC is at its best when it‚Äôs dark...that‚Äôs the reason I‚Äôve always preferred DC, leave the jokes to Marvel and the grittiness to DC...buzzing for this"
-_DJEzZk2pc,best trailer i hv ever seen
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:44 bodybuilders be like ‚Äúnice vacuum pose‚Äù
-_DJEzZk2pc,Trash
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow check it out, they made Gang weed into a movie, gamers rise up!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Norman Bates.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Marvel>DC
-_DJEzZk2pc,heath ledger RIP.
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:16 is everything.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Now this, this looks good."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Noone can match the acting level of heath ledger.happy birthay legend.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like a prequel to 'You were never really here'
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wasn't Leo DiCaprio supposed to play Joker?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I don‚Äôt get it, what am I missing. Everyone is digging on this, but it makes no sense to me. This is like a completely new character, this isn‚Äôt like the joker at all."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"it looks like penguin, not joker
miss u, River, u should play Joker with ur brother"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"https://youtu.be/8kFR5NpTWWA

Dear friends, here is link of my first music video. Pls watch it. If you like it then kindly share with others. Your feedback matters to me. Good or bad. Both are welcome. Regards -:)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fangirls will unfortunately still prefer Jared Leto
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:52 Damn Was it little Bruce Wayne ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Insane how good of an actor Joaquin is. He'll kill it. Leto is way too egotistical to play Joker, knew his would never be good"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wooo
-_DJEzZk2pc,Guess I'm the odd one out cause this doesnt interest me in the slightest. Turning joker into a tragic villain is kinda weird to me. But eh
-_DJEzZk2pc,When I heard 1:09 I instantly knew this is gonna be a good movie...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Vivimos en una sociedad con personas en la sociedad
-_DJEzZk2pc,YO YO YO HOL UP IS YOU PAPERBOI?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Nicholson's Joker : Comedian Gangster
Ledger's Joker : Psycho Gangster
Leto's Joker : Teenager Gangster
Phoenix Joker : Good People Turn Into Sadistic Gangster

Edit :
Romero's Joker : Legend Gangster
Monaghan's Joker :
Jerome : Brutal Gangster
Jeremiah : Intelegent Gangster
Third Joker : Crazy Gangster"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Knew he'd be the man for the job
-_DJEzZk2pc,I am so ready for this! He's gonna do a great job!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks great but those three dudes who punched him on the train do not look like the type of people who'd mug someone on a train.
-_DJEzZk2pc,is this canon?
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is gonna be depressing as hell
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hopefully the next Joker trailer  can be more action packed. I don't wanna go to the theater just to watch a depressing slow story of how a man became a psychotic clown!
-_DJEzZk2pc,The best part about the character of the Joker is that he has no origin story...but that gripe aside this movie looks great and Joaquin Phoenix is an amazing actor!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Man you have the compliments from Heath ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,I cant wait to see this üé•
-_DJEzZk2pc,no one can become like ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,Better than heath ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is it just me or does anyone else love the way he runs at 1:29 ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,didn't he become joker after falling into a bath of chemicals during a break in dressed up as red hood?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Still not better then the dark knight and I haven't saw it yet
-_DJEzZk2pc,Such an epic looking trailer and definitely on my must see list for this year..... Joaquin Phoenix looks amazing!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope there's still humor in this movie and they don't just go dark with it and make it all drama because the Joker is also supposed to be a funny character and I didn't see anything like that in this trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""Let's put a smile on ur face "" a beautiful sentence but damm creepy when u know its joker who will say it . Behind the the simple beautiful smile there is insanity and tragedy.  

I will say joker will be redefined again after ledger."

-_DJEzZk2pc,Happy birthday heath ledger ‚ù§Ô∏è
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It's really sad that I kind of stopped watching superhero movies, because for this I'm gonna have to make an exception."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wasn't interested, wait who? Phoenix? Count me in!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks brilliant!
-_DJEzZk2pc,All it takes is one bad day and woman not dateing nice guys
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks good, I hope it will compete to MCU. I like MCU but it's boring if they don't have any good competition"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Finally we will get to see everything that happened to a man who would become The Joker. This movie will be legendary and I think it will be good enough to be compared to Ledger‚Äôs joker, without being ridiculously over-the-top and insane. 

I ARE EXCITE"
-_DJEzZk2pc,No one replaces my joke.. one off the best villain in the wrld.. but he not live... we all miss u sir... nd always love u... üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢

-_DJEzZk2pc,im rooting for the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ummm...
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is a mistake.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I hope this film does well, not just review-wise but financially as well so that Warner Bros leanrs that this is the level of quality that people want in a DC movie, not that awful attempt that was the DCU series."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Omg.. Music in anthor world
-_DJEzZk2pc,We still need a movie from Voldemort's POV.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finaly a Movie without bad Jokes every 5 Minutes.
-_DJEzZk2pc,A Charlie Chaplin song makes everything better
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Robert De Niro dancing? So, a comedy movie then?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Goosebumps
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can anyone please help me share this. Liam Hemsworth is the right one to get the role of Batman. Armie Hammer just doesn't fit into that role.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can't wait to see this fucking movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I just cant wait for this plz come out already before i die :'(
-_DJEzZk2pc,The Joker is a bi-product of a single mother?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I wanted him to be the joker over Ledger,  thought Phoenix was born to play this role.  Of course Ledgers  joker is the gold standard now"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Something tells me DC is going to hit this one out the park! Marvel once End Game is out the way your days are numbered.
-_DJEzZk2pc,i am gonna say the n-word.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I wonder who's gonna be his enemy besides Batman
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why does no one at DC understand that the jokers face isn't supposed to be painted on. He's not a clown. He just has a really dark sense of humor. His face and body looks pale with green hair and red lips from an acid accident.  It because he painted it on to be a clown -.-
-_DJEzZk2pc,His character before he turned to the Joker gave off a Robin Williams vibe.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh, I am watching the JOKER... I am already scared, lolololol... Nobody, has ever done a Joker movie before..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,that laugh its soo real and creepy! LOVE IT!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Omg this is gonna be so awesome. i cant wait!!!!! They picked the perfect actor to play as the joker üÉè
-_DJEzZk2pc,One thing I don't like about JP being a Joker: there won't be a sequel.
-_DJEzZk2pc,ARE ALL YOU FUCKEN RETARDED? THIS IS A PIECE OF SHIT COMING OUT MY ASS AND IT HASNT HIT THE FLOOR YET . ARE YOU GUYS GETTING PAID FOR YOUR COMMENTS ? I SEEN THIS VIDEO 20 FUCKEN TIMES AND IT MADE ME THROW UP EVERY TIME SOME ONE PLEASE PUT IT OUT ITS MISERY
-_DJEzZk2pc,Great trailer didn‚Äôt shoe the plot
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie looks dumb
-_DJEzZk2pc,If joker and batman come together fans dream come true batfleck forever.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Epic trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,Huh.....WOW. This is an interesting take. My mind is telling me the suit at the end is what Cesar Romero's Joker wore in the Batman TV series. Someone find out and correct me if I'm wrong.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gonna be crazy good üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin Phoenix is KILLING IT! 
Most awaited movie of the year for me"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Jouaqin Phoenix is amazing. Just his physical transformation from his latest role as Joe in ""You were never really here"" to the Joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Security are beating up the clown ... again
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Batman is what we want to be, Joker is what society turns us into.
Batman tries to see best in society but Joker is the one who has been through the worst of society. 
Its really sad when u cry out of pain worst part is when u start laughing at it, the moment when innocence dies and Joker is born."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Simply wonderful; I cannot wait.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This already looks like a masterpiece
-_DJEzZk2pc,i really like this trailer i believe this movie looks like its got that look that the good batman trilogy had. i still would like to see jarred letto do joker i think that has a lot of potential
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks like they're doing some adaptation of the killing joke backsotry. This is great, really captures the insanity and also the tragedy of the joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yes
-_DJEzZk2pc,Honestly it looks boring
-_DJEzZk2pc,For the love of god please don‚Äôt suck
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Phoenix is a Master, truly"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"oooooooookaaaayyyy this shit looks like garbage, i'm not on board with this film anymore"
-_DJEzZk2pc,B in October at the end that reminds me of...
-_DJEzZk2pc,This does not look good. Phoenix is possibly the worst Joker yet.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Some people was born evil and others the life made them evil. I think the joker belongs to the second group as Davy Jones from Pirates of the Caribbean.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"his facial expression, and he got the crazy eyes"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Humanity is just a comedy that will end in tragedy. It takes one bad day for one push to insanity and curiosity makes a psychopath

-_DJEzZk2pc,heath ledger was a great joker hopefully this one is
-_DJEzZk2pc,What's the theme song this trailer:)
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally no buttman
-_DJEzZk2pc,this is gonna be a masterpiece!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Never thought I would see a Joker who could be as perfect for the role as Ledger. I really hope this film will be as good as this trailer makes it look.

-_DJEzZk2pc,"No.

Joaquin Phoenix as Joker is most likely a great casting.  But I don't want another joker origin story.  The best part of joker is when he has NO origin at all.  Did they learn nothing from Killing Joke? 

I don't want Joker to be humanized.  He is much better as a nobody, as an anarchist bent on only chaos."

Phoenix should have been The Joker a long time ago, Suicide Squad still wouldn't have been absolutely amazing or something, but with Phoenix instead of Leto, it would have been much much better then what we got, and we would be getting a proper sequel instead of it getting rebooted already by James Gunn like they're doing now..."

-_DJEzZk2pc,"For those confused why Bruce Wayne is a little kid during this Jokers rise, heres my theory.


In the trailer, you see multiple people wearing clown masks in the riot & the subway scene! This implies that the JOKER will
create chaotic events that unknowingly ""inspire"" people in GOTHAM & a future person with similar mental issues/experiences that will take up the JOKER mantle. ESPECIALLY IF IN THE FUTURE A BATMAN FIGURE ARISE! Almost symbolically challenging someone to step up &
be the JOKER. 


Its similar to the GOTHAM tv show, where when the Jerome becomes the Joker, he inspires crazies even after his incarnation/death. 
I feel that even though this is a stand alone film, it will give us some sort of idea that any DCEU Joker we see involved with, for example, The Justice League, it will be implied that the JOKER they face will have been inspired by Joaquin's joker. 


BUT then again, I've heard this may be the first in DC VIllain SOLO Films in which they are freed from having to direct a movie 
while having to keep in mind some greater connected storyline. 


Either way Im fucking excited."
-_DJEzZk2pc,But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs gonna be as scary as it could be

If Batman won't appear in the movie (he still can, as its unlikely they'll actually let the Joker escape justice at the end of the film), its gonna be the first real all DC Supervillain movie. Risky, but one worth taking. (Venom is more of an anti hero; the Suicide Squad are forced to be a good guy troupe.)
Hope this new version of the Joker works out.
My fave versions are: Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson & Mark Hamill (for the animated version). Maybe Mr. Phoenix will be #4."

-_DJEzZk2pc,"First movie in the DCEEU.

*DC Extra-Extended Universe."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Surprisingly, this looks very interesting. It might actually work as a Batman-less stand-alone. Still, if it works, I'd love for it to get a sequel with Batman in it. But not go the full expanded universe route. Go Dark Knight style. Maybe do a few movies in this style centered on the Batman Rogues Gallery, and just add a dash of Batman at the end to wrap things up (even keep his appearance a secret from audiences).

I find this refreshing. I wish Hollywood would realize crafting nuanced, captivating villains that aren't pure evil (that have human elements we can relate to) makes for great storytelling. Villains are people too, and for all their bad, may have some good."

-_DJEzZk2pc,Soy el unico que vino por el rubius? Si? Ok.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Stop it! Just... stop!


Now the Joker is actually a ""good guy"" who just gets pushed around too much and mental illness takes hold? Makes him much less scary than the psychopathic criminal version. This looks more like an artistic take on mental illness. Although, I admit it's a bit more relatable to today's societal problems regarding mental illness."

-_DJEzZk2pc,They're gonna kill Zazie Beetz aren't they?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think you and I just came in our collective pants after watching this...  I am going to go clean myself off after this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,It actually looks...not half-bad?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Meh. Wheres the purple suit? Fuck this artistic reinterpretation.
-_DJEzZk2pc,IM ECSTATIC THAT THEY ARE USING AN ACTOR WHO CAN DIVE DEEP INTO THE JOKERs PERSONALITY LIKE HEATH LEDGER DID!!!!! THANK YOU because the Joker is such a realistic character that we can always relate too!!

-_DJEzZk2pc,That looked so lame and boring.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Serious fucking goosebumps
-_DJEzZk2pc,13-50.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I think the way Joaquin is portraying the character is incredibly unique and the way in which the entire film is being carried out is incredibly brave. The tone and scope of the film is going to be unbelievable. My personal opinion is that it will be incomparable to The Dark Knight. Heath Ledger‚Äôs performance is incredible and cannot go unspoken, the character will undergo many alterations over time and his portrayal of the character will not be forgotten. I cannot wait for the Joker film and what it will bring to the expansion of the already amazing icon. Joaquin is an amazing actor and he will do a great job, judging from what has already been shown. How he is shown in the trailer will only be a glimpse of the Clown Prince of Gotham and I hope the film will deliver on the insanity and brutality I believe it should deliver."
-_DJEzZk2pc,THIS SONG
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks SO GOOD!
-_DJEzZk2pc,That laugh do
-_DJEzZk2pc,So they sticking to original Joker backstory except falling acid tank. Interesting
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks so good! I hope it lives up to the expectations.
-_DJEzZk2pc,But how can i know he is damaged if it‚Äôs not written on his forhead????

-_DJEzZk2pc,Norman Bates vibes
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This world could be completely cruel, anyone could feel attached to his feelings and his eventual downfall spiral without a proper guidance, seems to me it will be a great story and a tremendous performance by Joaquin Phoenix, haven¬¥t been so hyped since Logan¬¥s trailer, and as some of you have mentioned it earlier or in a Heath Ledger JOker tone of voice ""great of song"""

HAHAHAHAHAHA...HA..HAHAHA..HA...."
-_DJEzZk2pc,WOOW! I think he scares me more than It jajajajaja
-_DJEzZk2pc,this looks gooooood!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,enough with joker. enough. hes a shit villain and not anywhere near being the top villain of batmans. hes not that important!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I‚Äôll see this movie, but not at the theater. I don‚Äôt support pedowood anymore."
-_DJEzZk2pc,He didnt fight back at all or laugh when he got punched he just took it like a bish tbh his laughing was on point and the way they have his body positioned is cool but i also dont like the make up or fake hair as much i guess i shouldnt judge so much but this doesnt feel like an origin story for the joker it feels more like a random guy going insane unlike the smart manipulative and dark humoured joker i grew up watching animated or on the big screen
-_DJEzZk2pc,As soon as we found out about Joaquin Phoenix taking on this role I knew immediately that we're about to witness something very special. A performance like this only occurs a few times in a generation and Heath Ledger is one of those few who achieved that greatness. Not a single person has even come close to what Heath did but now we finally have someone who just may rise to that level and no other actor on this planet could have pulled this off other than Joaquin Phoenix.
-_DJEzZk2pc,no BATMAN no joke
-_DJEzZk2pc,I guarantee he will win the Oscar for this. Don't have to watch the whole move to make that decision
-_DJEzZk2pc,"My favorite actor, I am really pumped for this!"

-_DJEzZk2pc,Can't stop watching this
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This made my day. A feel a sadness and heartbreak for one of pop culture most twisted fucks. That's how you do it! A total character study that makes me feel sympathy and disgust.  Raw and paired down. This version of Joker could be added to the pillars that Nicholson & Ledger established. Maaaan, I can't wait to see this. This became my most anticipated movie for 2019!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,FUCK. I chill.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I guess I'm missing something, I'd rather watch a dogs asshole than this trailer again, idk maybe it'll be a good movie but I'm not getting that from this trailer."
-_DJEzZk2pc,All it takes is one bad day!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Way more chillin joker then ever....u can‚Äôt read him
-_DJEzZk2pc,Holy shit...  did DC finally make a good movie based around the joker?  I am in aw.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like this could be a classic
-_DJEzZk2pc,And batman cant beat joker why ??
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I honestly hope this movie exceeds all expectations, but remember when the Suicide Squad trailer came out in August 2016 and we all thought it was going to be incredible?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is crazy I am getting crazy Phoenix was meant for this job heath passed his batton to Phoenix.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Seriously, I am getting sick of origin story movies."
-_DJEzZk2pc,There's no joker without Batman
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fuck! Fuck the 70s! Is this fan made shit?!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I haven't looked up anything about this movie but I can't help but notice the lack of...well Batman. Leading me to wonder, is that kid at 1:51 Bruce?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,So funny seeing all the non comic readers in the comments who think Ledger was good. Whereas all the comic fans know Mark is the gold standard.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This joker is dc dynomite
-_DJEzZk2pc,This trailer makes me feel sad UwU
-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôm not feeling it
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Lets not get too eager, DC is known for putting up great trailers"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So dramatic, so sad, so different... seeing by the perspective of a joker who gets evil by the evil acts of society."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This looks really good but im sure people will cry about it being too dark and somber like they did with the Superman movie. I mean i get it, but a story about an alien dropping down to earth with God like powers never seen before by humans shouldn't be this cheery, comedic story like Superman of the 80s and 90s. DC may have had some missteps, but the amount of hate some of previous films received was definitely undeserved. I hope this film does well, DC has been doing awesome lately, even the haters couldn't complain. I've enjoyed all of marvel hero movies as well, but i just didn't see where they were leagues better than movies like Man of Steel or even BvS."
-_DJEzZk2pc,DEPRESSING
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Every time I watch this it becomes a little creepier. I feel like this joker is going to be deeply disturbing, but you won't think about just how disturbing until after you leave the theatre and it's in hindsight."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Damn! Damn!....Daaammn! 
This shit looks good! üòÅ"
-_DJEzZk2pc,üíØlooks good
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nope im not falling for it this time ill wait for the reviews suicide squad had a great trailer so did BVS and justice league and none of those movies are good and their movies were completely different from the trailers then say oh buy the extended version on blu-ray
-_DJEzZk2pc,He's definitely one my picks for s joker. I think Jim Carey could do it the best
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm impressed, well done."
-_DJEzZk2pc,i hope they rated R!! Please..
-_DJEzZk2pc,Holy F#ckn Sh*t!!! This movie looks like a hootüò≤
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fuck yea
-_DJEzZk2pc,Marvel - we have hulk  DC - we have joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix is the next Daniel Day Lewis
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow..I thought this was gonna be another lame.cash grab....but this shit looks LEGIT!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,My body is so ready for this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh lala
-_DJEzZk2pc,Omg. No words.
-_DJEzZk2pc,These kind of role changes u from within...I hope he doesn't do something tragic like Ledger...üòîüò£
-_DJEzZk2pc,The good thing is that the Suicide Squad joker is finally gone
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:09 !!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Look at all the brain dead fucking morons in this comment section. Holy shit. Society would , has, definitely driven me to the brink of insanity. *READ A FUCKING COMIC BOOK!*"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Try try try as u might
-_DJEzZk2pc,The new season of Atlanta looks crazy
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm not a big DC, marvel guy. Like all the movies. But this looks pretty damn good"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix will be the only who can do it better then heath... but I doubt it!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I was really excited for this trailer, but then I realized that this was the wrong joker..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Intriguing for sure
-_DJEzZk2pc,Music please???
-_DJEzZk2pc,"that smile 1:15, that was something else..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Why So Serious?!!!!
-Bruce Wayne"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I think this movie will be good ,, or more than just good ,,"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"0:44 What happen to his left shoulder ? 2:00 Woooo......hoo.... Robert de Niro. I can't wait to see the movie. Anyway, only Heath and this Joker which can make me smile. Joaquin's Joker make me smile from all the good news, such as this trailer."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow!  Looks intense.  Love that he's wearing the iconic purple suit.
-_DJEzZk2pc,the joker is literally me
-_DJEzZk2pc,Que bosta
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If this movie goes well, I think a bioshock movie may come around"
-_DJEzZk2pc,He got that Brandon lee type body in the crow Joaquin I think can play the crow too üíØ
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks like an indie version of the joker... is no one else really seeing that? Like it‚Äôs going to have some ironic ending... or no ending at all... just go black at the end
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can see him being next joker in a new batman movie would rather have him then Jared leto joker he didn't seem like a leader of a crime syndicate
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope we don‚Äôt lose another good actor to this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Cameron Monaghan owns it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Cameron Monaghan owns it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker Clan???
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fuck Jared Leto
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope the movie is WAAAY better than the trailer.... This is THE impossible movie to make soo... Damn i hope it's good
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Please, PLEASE let the movie be as good as the trailer makes it look."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Loving him since the Gladiator. He'll kill this one! An amazing actor!  <3
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Anyone else, excited af for this movie?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,finaly we can say we have a good jocker act !! heath is dead guys lets move on
-_DJEzZk2pc,The Marvel soy boys are gonna react üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
-_DJEzZk2pc,idk looks decent but not what everyone cracks it to be
-_DJEzZk2pc,They better not turn him into a hero like Venom/Suicide Squad
-_DJEzZk2pc,Usually I prefer Joker without an origin but this looks fascinating.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Aren't you glad to live in a world where Joaquin Phoenix exists?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"His origin seems really boring. 


He was a sign spinner and some people beat him up so he turned into the Joker?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie about to be fire
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is going to be great
-_DJEzZk2pc,"‚ÄúThe funniest part of having a mental illness is that people expect you to act like you don‚Äôt‚Äù. Damn, that was written on the piece of paper"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Fantastic, great choice in origin story!
Can‚Äôt wait to see the ending where everything is a flashback and the joker says, ‚Äúalthough other days I remember it differently, it never remains the same. I like it that way.‚Äù
That would be a nice ending.     :)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Already better than Jared Leto
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""Insanity is just... one... bad... day... away.""- Joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,not for me
-_DJEzZk2pc,Holy shit! A comic book movie I actually want to see
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC has found their Logan.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now if they can figure batman out.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"My thoughts on this, is that him showering his mother??!?!? ü§¢ü§¢ but in all seriousness I love the way they're making a sympathetic joker. He seems to have been a good guy with good intentions driven to evil by a cruel world. I love that they mentioned the mother clearly she will be an important part of this story which means they won't take the ""killing joke"" backstory route. Also I love that the trailer doesn't make it obvious what the movies about and that laugh at 1:27 after he gets punched OMFGGGGG"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"can smone give me a loan 
im broke af and there are a lot of movies i need to watch"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Still have no idea what this movie is about.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Orang jahat lahir dari orang baik yang tersakiti
-_DJEzZk2pc,I thought this was a fucking rumor last year...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks maybe over done. But compared to The god awful Juggalo Joker we had from Suicide Squad. I'll take it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin Phoenix (Joker) - looks like a masterclass in acting - somewhere, Heath Ledger is smiling, beaming with pride. He would so have loved Joaquin as a choice to do this. An actor's actor."
-_DJEzZk2pc,We can pretend that Jared Leto as Joker never existed?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks boring
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie looks like it can be good but not like it‚Äôs gonna do anything for DC even if it is seeing as it‚Äôs not connected to the DCEU
-_DJEzZk2pc,Choke on this Marvel Universe. DC has the best villain character ever created in comic book history. #TheJoker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"God damn it, this is why people are afraid of clowns DC."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow that looks... good. 
Shit.


I know it's unlikely... and I'm probably just wrong...
But I think the only thing that could make me enjoy this more if is some form/representation of Batman acted as the antagonist."
-_DJEzZk2pc,is that....old school joker clothes? HELL YES
-_DJEzZk2pc,0:59 the hospital is shaking... top corner right lol
-_DJEzZk2pc,Omg I‚Äôm in love with this movie already!!!! I love the story of how Joker goes crazy and this looks like it‚Äôs gonna capture it so well!!! I love Joker he‚Äôs my favorite villain!!üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üíúüíúüíúüíúüÉè
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is my fifth time watching this trailer.. Phoenix is truly one of a kind
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So many bandwagon on this ish, teasers don't give much. Heath is my Joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Show's you that cgi isn't everything the heck with fake super hero movies all green screen this movie shows that a story is more important than flying idiots and 10 year old spider boys and yes thank God Affleck is not Batman anymore so in October Hollywood might get a ticket from me for this movie üòÅ
-_DJEzZk2pc,Love it
-_DJEzZk2pc,Great choice of song
-_DJEzZk2pc,My LoveüçÅ MySoulüñ§ insanely Watin! BIG LOVE BREAK MY TRIP AFTER SO LONG MAN SO LONG HONESTY üçÅüñ§üñ§üñ§üñ§üñ§ I FEEL GOOD I FELL BEETER THATS MY WAY COME MOTHERFUKERüíÄ
-_DJEzZk2pc,Uu love it
-_DJEzZk2pc,My healing from the scars left by that garbage jared leto joker can begin!
-_DJEzZk2pc,0:48 creepy body
-_DJEzZk2pc,what a joke
-_DJEzZk2pc,We need a Jake gyhlenhall joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:51  Bruce Wayne
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now he deserves a good batman
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So yeah, is it just me or does this movie look really good even as a stand alone movie not set in the DC Universe?üëçüèª"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The best thing is that this doesn't try to be like Ledger's Joker, but it's own thing."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sometimes you get that feeling about a movie being either good or bad by just the teaser alone. For me this movie looks like it‚Äôs going to be incredible by how well the movie was delivered by the trailer. Here‚Äôs hoping.
-_DJEzZk2pc,That's the joker I know.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not a fan of the makeup. Still hoping it's not the final look of the joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"i love movies where you feel bad for the ""bad guy"" this looks like one of them"
-_DJEzZk2pc,and the Oscar goes to...‚Ä¶..JOAQUIN PHOENIX -JOKER.....hahahaha
-_DJEzZk2pc,Only casual fans think that this will rival Heath's performance. He's already acted more like the actual Joker than Heath ever did.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Honestly, it doesn't look that great to me, but the fact that Joaquin Phoenix is playing the lead gives me faith it could actually be a decent film."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Epic
-_DJEzZk2pc,"yup, not watching it. though, not bad for trailer"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"dress as the joker and become ultra cool, ultra loose"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wheres are all the craziness of joker?
-_DJEzZk2pc,the jocker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Briliant
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC has some crazy teaser trailers. This looks amazing. Hope the movie is as good as this makes it look!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is looking interesting, not what I imagined."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ok, NOW I'm interested."
-_DJEzZk2pc,What is the song in the trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel bad for old Ronald McDonald...
-_DJEzZk2pc,I smell Oscar
-_DJEzZk2pc,Did somebody said oscar got that rightüëç
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally a decent looking film from DC.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow. Just wow.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I sure hope the movie is better than the trailer.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Take my money
-_DJEzZk2pc,promising might be the first comic movie with no corny ass line and joke for a very long time.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Let‚Äôs put a smile on that face
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC is starting to have a comeback
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can‚Äôt wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Movie looks good, make up is corny as fuck though. Now the part where everyone disagrees with me."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hope most DC movies can be like this
-_DJEzZk2pc,it looks like they aimed to make a compelling movie and it just happens to be about the Joker.  I dig it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,You can fell the pain in he‚Äôs voiceüòî
-_DJEzZk2pc,You can fell the pain in he‚Äôs voiceüòî
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ehhh. Looks too much like oscar bait for me. I'll check back in when the next trailer drops, but until then this is a hard pass in the theater and a maybe when it gets to netflix."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like a good movie but it doesn‚Äôt feel like a Joker in the dc
-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôm impressed.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Atlanta crew üî•
-_DJEzZk2pc,Love  this  all about  the  Joker all about  the  vill
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wooow casted a great actor for the role...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"In an insane World, only the Mad are sane!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Love the trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm more excited for this than endgame yeah that's right, fight me tell me I'm wrong it won't change my opinion"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think Jerrod Letto did a better job in suicide squad cause the laugh the tattoo smile and the make-up was great and for everyone who say he did horrible is weird
-_DJEzZk2pc,If this trailer is like the movie I will be impressed
-_DJEzZk2pc,Im expecting this to do bad like every other dc movie but once again Im hoping it doesnt
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I think we are all low key worried that we might have to finally admit Heath has been outperformed. The man was a legend, and legends never die, but new hero‚Äôs rise."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I just watched the trailer to SPLIT 2
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is the greatest film in cinama history
-_DJEzZk2pc,Getting some Taxi Driver vibes from this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can‚Äôt wait this will be the best joker üÉè hands down
-_DJEzZk2pc,"i don't like it, i'd rather have margot robbie do more of her shit."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Meh.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I believe this will glorify being a ""villian"". Good movie for entertainment. But there's good be all kinds of shootings after this movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yeah... But where is Batman?
-_DJEzZk2pc,This will be a breath of fresh air compared to the disaster Shazam
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm all in.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"DC is saved.
Hisoka is schwinging right now."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oscar nom
-_DJEzZk2pc,great...... but it can never be perfect like Heath Ledger.........Hit like for Heath Ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is a interpretation I can get behind.
-_DJEzZk2pc,And this is not on trending... How?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ugh, you can SEE the emotion and the mystery/ craziness in his eyes. I‚Äôm really excited for this, I think they will nail it again like they did with Heath."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I just saw the early release of this movie and everybody dies at the end üòã
-_DJEzZk2pc,i LOVE that he looks like a proper clown! im actually excited to see this!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hate the fucking makeup....give me my joker from the comics and we have a deal hopefully it leads to that
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sorry but HEATH LEDGER is always the best üíûüíûüíû
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:45 isn‚Äôt that Jim Gordon‚Äôs friend from the Dark Knight?
-_DJEzZk2pc,This says a lot about our society....
-_DJEzZk2pc,"the best joker's smile, when he not wearing make upüôå"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Don't personally get the hype
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ok was that supposed to be a young Bruce Wayne behind those bars talking to joker?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Puts leto's joker to shame lol
-_DJEzZk2pc,What a creepy song
-_DJEzZk2pc,Big Boi and The Earn girlfriend's (PAPER BOOOYY!!!!)
-_DJEzZk2pc,Whoa.... That was an amazing trailer....
-_DJEzZk2pc,intense trailer at it very best ...........great work by the great Joaquin
-_DJEzZk2pc,I don‚Äôt get it ü§î
-_DJEzZk2pc,damn looks like he starved himself for this role. lost lots of weight.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can we stop with the movie cliche of NYC subways being spray painted over and thugs hanging out there? It's not like that at all!!!!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,a joker origin movie?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Am I the only one who thinks this will not be such a great film? I mean, he's still the JOKER, he lives in Gotham City, he fights Batman. Even pretentious authors who enjoy making everything ""adult"", like Alan Moore or Frank Miller, allow themselves to be a little silly. 

Don't even make me speak about Nolan. He's even more fun and silly. His Joker was dark but also funny. This looks more like an Oscar bait for fans of those facebook pages with images of the Joker saying filosophical crap."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow! Looks like not the usually mainstream DC movie. It looks like an arthouse drama with an amazing Joaquin Phoenix. This is the real shit!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks awesome i cant wait till this comes out in theaters its just sooo perfect
-_DJEzZk2pc,Thank you thank you thank you !!!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"At 1:50 Heath Ledger's voice came into my head: ""let's put a smile on that face"""
-_DJEzZk2pc,This joker actually seems like he‚Äôs actually crazy with his actions and movements. Instead of the one in suicide squad trying to look cool and look good for the camera.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"so, is joker a hero in this film?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,0:15 Is that the staircase in Upper Manhattan near Inwood park????????
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can't wait. I sure wish I could play that role.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can't wait to see this. Looks amazing.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Welcome to the mad house Batman!
-_DJEzZk2pc,NO ONE WILL BE BETTER THAN HEATHS joker JUS LIKE BATMAN DIED WITH BALE...BUT THIS ISNT RELATED TO THE BATMAN MOVIES SO ILL SEE IT AND GIVE IT A TRY..... ONKY WAY THIS CAN SUCCEED AT ALL IS IF ITS R-RATED. JUS LIKE HEATHS JOKER SHOULDA BEEN R RATED TJIS CANT BE PG13
-_DJEzZk2pc,Some 9k people that will now be found over by the ‚ÄúSmile‚Äù song video leaving comments like: ‚Äúlike if Joker trailer brought you here‚Äù üôÑü§£
-_DJEzZk2pc,Jared leto can quit this is my joker now. I had more fun watching this trailer than anything from joker in suicide squad.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is going to be gooood
I just know it!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Not the Joker we asked for, but the one we need."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks good, unfortunately it has deniro in it... i hope he gets his brains blown out"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm not sure if I'll keep my sanity after watching this joker. It's deep.
-_DJEzZk2pc,love it !
-_DJEzZk2pc,Holy fuck this looks amazing I just hope they go to traditional face paint
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fun Fact : This dropped on Heath Ledger's birthday.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Where r the scars. Where is the good face paint? Why so...
Serious?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is PERFECT!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The worst part is that you can easily identify who that guy is
 no one would ever go I wonder if the joker is? One Google search hell even before Google youd easily go, oh the guy from the news or that stand up show, no mystery at all... 
Not to mention the or around the joker simply States he had to shtick together when he started, there was no pre-joker figuring out himself phase as far as I know... Maybe a comic somewhere"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why am I getting V for Vendetta vibes from this?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Trash!! They should of went a different route
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ya know, his performance looks pretty good. Hopefully dc doesn‚Äôt horribly fuck up every other part of this movie like they always do"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It's obviously going to be a while before the world can move on past Heath Ledger's Joker, but still looks like this will be pretty good."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh I get it this is the guy before the joker like a bad prototype
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I don't like it. looks stupid. if you give joker a back story the mystery disapears. also, what about the most recent joker from suicide squad. they are planning more movies....or do we just forget about him"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Poor DC is watching their univers fall apart and are grasping at straws to stay relevant.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Stay with the dark shit like this DC. Do not compete with Marvel and you'll win.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nun like his origin story that would‚Äôve been way better that‚Äôs why cartoons are better
-_DJEzZk2pc,Great. An arthouse joker movie that takes two hours to get to the point. Talk shit but that's what it's gonna be.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I hope, I really hope this movie honours its trailer. Cause it is one hell of a trailer. A goddamn promise."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel like he's going to put a smile on our faces... but fear in our souls
-_DJEzZk2pc,"the gritty 70s NY looks fantastic,

btw, the scene where you can see steps and a city skyline is my old hood, Washington Heights, NYC. (in reality you cant see the city skyline from top of stairs)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"We remember how great the suicide squad trailer was and look how that turned out, I‚Äôm excited but I won‚Äôt be disappointed"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Seems like I might be the only one not completely sold on this yet...
-_DJEzZk2pc,@1:09 was creepy as hell that laugh
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's about time that joker is taken seriously this movie is going to be absolutely beautiful.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"When I found out Heath Ledger was going to be playing The Joker, I thought, ""Wait, the cat from '10 Things I Hate About You' and #GayCowboysEatingPudding?"" Nobody could replace Jack Nicholson, I thought, especially not that guy. I mocked the idea. And then he made me eat those words.

Please tell me that's about to happen again."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now make a part 2 already cuz i know these movie is goin to be a tease...giving me goosebumps
-_DJEzZk2pc,"yeah another ""he was never there"" , ! Not in the comic books, not in any Batman story ever written, not a got damn thing to do with DC whatsoever, just that Heath Ledger did such a great twist on the original Joker theme from the comics, as done by Nicholson, the damn villain is more of an epic then the Batman comic book it came from, especially now that Gotham has been pimped into a TV series ?? GTFOH , with this pathetic ""He needs a Hug "" bullshyt! The real Joker was someone who could make you laugh , and you wont even realize he just shot you in the foot ! Phoenix couldnt make anyone laugh, so he takes out his lack of comic talent on the world as a damn DC villain?? No wonder Scorcese backed out !"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow amazing
-_DJEzZk2pc,wooooooow
-_DJEzZk2pc,They certainly picked someone with the acting chop to pull this off. Looks multi-dimensional and interesting. Will see it
-_DJEzZk2pc,society man
-_DJEzZk2pc,"As much as I loved Heath Ledger‚Äôs performance, Joaquin seems to have tapped into something even more intense and bravura.  Even in the trailer, you can see a lonely, socially inept man with possible mental illness desperately trying to maintain a hold on the ladder of sanity as each rung being taken away from him.  Something feels very special about this performance and this film.  Todd Phillips has brilliantly channeled The King of Comedy and Taxi Driver into this production.  The lighting, tone and color correction is very much in the vein of those indie greasy humid late 70s concrete thrillers that works perfectly for this film.  Loving this on every level."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please be rated R
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heath ledger was still better
-_DJEzZk2pc,SAD CLOWN is an overused trope. Joker is not the sad clown. He's a sadistic sociopath.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The laugh at 1:27 reminded me of Ledger‚Äôs Joker. Hopefully this lives up to his amazing performance
-_DJEzZk2pc,M I am going crazy or it is seriously going to be like the Dark Knight.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"this movie gives me such clockwork orange vibes i love it, the music gives me chills i‚Äôm excited"
-_DJEzZk2pc,It covers the same context of my life.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"this looks amazing, but it‚Äôs a different backstory from i‚Äôve heard abt ü§î"
-_DJEzZk2pc,A peek into the mind/life of a future mass shooter
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow this looks like shit.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"DC keeps getting wrong, aqua man, batman vs superman, sucide squad...Lets hope they get this right"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Goosebumps.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow. This is....




Awesome"
-_DJEzZk2pc,That's awesome
-_DJEzZk2pc,the song is by Nat King .. but this one im not sure who sings it >> if u know do tell
-_DJEzZk2pc,The kid he puts a smile on is Bruce Wayne
-_DJEzZk2pc,HE'S GONNA SAY IT.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is like heath ledger's joker in the making
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope we get to see how he gets his scars!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Nope!!! Looks dumb AF!!! If they can‚Äôt stick to the origin of a character, then don‚Äôt bother with changing him!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,How crazy would that be if the kid he grills is Bruce Wayne
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Do you think the boy, who Joker puts a smile on his face is Bruce Wayne?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Great acting, but this story appears derivative AF.  I hope I'm wrong"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"A psychological thriller for a character designed for psychological thrillers?? Mamma Mia they finally figured it out.

Jokes and joker aside, this movie looks like something that should have existed long ago as a classic."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Man I just really really hope this works.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks badass as fuck!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks good. I don't mind having pity for the joker but don't make us think he's a good guy like maleficent
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks awesome. Cant wait
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Oh, another movie where we see how the joker becomes the joker, and another version of the story.... yawn"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why so serious ?!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Iff you... justt SMILLEEE !!

That ""smile"" reminded me of somone"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This will be, i expect, one of those characters that will break an actor. Something they dove far into they become an ebodiement and essence of what is that character. I pray for Joaquin because we cant survive another heath ledger. Rest in Peace heath, Your memory is not forgotten and you WILL live on threw your torture."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Jared Leto's Joker? KO!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,i see you paperboy!
-_DJEzZk2pc,A interesting take on the character
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally the real trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The three homage's 1)Modern Times(1936) & Charlie Chaplin in general 2) Taxi Driver 3) Psycho. Because, 1) themes, dancing, the smile with the fingers: 2) Ominous pacing, porn theater, the dinner date with the lady friend, 3) creepy relationship with Mom"
-_DJEzZk2pc,ho lee shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,seriously though.. wtf is this shit?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Please be good, please!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now all he need is batman to complete his life.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks amazing
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yessssss finally a good joker after Heath Amen now let‚Äôs put a smile on our face hahahhahhhh
-_DJEzZk2pc,"When i say joker, this is what i'm asking for"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yea I‚Äôm gonna go see this. It‚Äôll most likely be what saves Dc lol
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks stupid
-_DJEzZk2pc,Alright that's DC getting as much distance from the suicide squad joker as possible. It sure looks interesting tho
-_DJEzZk2pc,beautiful
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,It all began ....with that smile that damned smile..
-_DJEzZk2pc,Jared Leto did a great service by being the joker after Ledger. Otherwise this would be the movie everyone would be hating on.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This looks very interesting and original.

I can't wait!!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,The thing that I like is that the Joker's story has always been mysterious. I hope they keep it that way. My hope is that the movie ends and you realize that this is just another story. I would have the movie end with him sitting at one end of the tableand Harley Quinn sitting at the other end as his shrink back in arkham asylum. The idea is that this is the story that woos her. Thoughts?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not as good as Glass
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow I love Jim Carrey
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is that De Niro making a reference to the great film the King of Comedy?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Still can‚Äôt live up to Heath‚Äôs joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Damn, I didn‚Äôt know I needed this until I saw it."
-_DJEzZk2pc,There is no Joker without Heath Ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yes.
-_DJEzZk2pc,scary
-_DJEzZk2pc,"That smile..





That damn smile...."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Utter nonsense!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Gonna be a bit harder to root for batman, or the people of Gotham after we've sympathized with the Joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"wow, awesome stuff. I hope this doesn't suck."
-_DJEzZk2pc,this looks freakin awesome
-_DJEzZk2pc,I didn‚Äôt get anything from that ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
-_DJEzZk2pc,It looks silly to me.
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's better when it is a comic book character in a movie that doesn't look like it came from a comic book.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally!! The Origin of Insanity
-_DJEzZk2pc,I love this psycho
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh yeah.  You had better watch out for those White guys in Suits on the new york subways.   Jesus Christ...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow
-_DJEzZk2pc,eh could go either way
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Okay, I‚Äôm officially on board for this now!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Let's put a SMILE on that face!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks like shit not gonna lie. It's just about a guy that gets beat up a lot and that somehow gives him the opportunity to go insane. Joker fanboys come at me.
-_DJEzZk2pc,0:31-0:40 I actually feel bad for joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sorry but Heath is still the best Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"please, please, please don't disappoint me."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Include the credits at the end of the trailer. Thanks.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Havnt said this for years about a comic movie... LOOKS AWESOME.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"So, I like Joaquin Phoenix, but am I supposed to go with Joker's origin is when he's 45 years old?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"i was waiting for THIS, damn took DC a while to get their shit together"
-_DJEzZk2pc,the song kinda fucked the trailer tbh
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ohw god. This looks incredible. Now just find a proper batman. And you got yourself a franchise again.  And no fucking superman this time ffs.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Haters get out here,Joaquin is perfect actor and this trailer is so amazing."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm on the fence if it wasn't going against changing Jokers origin story and had this style movie making it would be awesome almost good as Captain America Winter Solider.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think this is the background or history of the dark Knight's joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,I got Chills down my spine...whew...Joaquin Phoenix is the best!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope this delivers! I won't criticize until I see it.  Looks good so far! Different but good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Trust me when I say this..he is in his form as he was in ""The Master"" you could see this in his body language, I think I am spot when I say that he was only chosen for this role of ""The Joker"" due to his work in ""The Master""."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The worst part of having a mental illness is
People expect you to behave as if you don't.
       -Joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like DC have another hit on their hands.
-_DJEzZk2pc,That laugh gave me goosebumps üëçüèªüí®
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is EPIC <3
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wtf?! This legit looks amazing. Please be good. Please be good. Please be good!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"great casting for the joker role, but I don't like how they changed the story of how he became the joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,We all know DC can put out some incredible trailers... lets see how good it is when it comes out. You won't trick me again DC lmao
-_DJEzZk2pc,Become ledger simulator film
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Sold, not a big fan of part of the face makeup but, this looks intriguing, I'm looking forward for this movie.


Also...


Society"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm gonna miss the purple suit and red lipstick, but I do kinda like the old timey look of this setting."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This looks like a great TV series, too bad it's a movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I sort of feel that they have not brought back the real Joaquin Phoenix in this, if you really want to know what Joaquin Phoenix can do to a character, just watch ""The Master"". I cannot think of anyone who could have taken a role like that and done something unbelievable and extraordinary as he did. But this is Joaquin Phoenix and that too in the character of a Joker, this one I cannot miss."
-_DJEzZk2pc,looks shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,"DC movies done right:

Batman begins
Darknight
Darknight rises
Aquaman
Shazam
Joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,hyped as fuck about this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hey have you guys ever wondered what happens after you die?
-_DJEzZk2pc,It looks more comic-accurate than Heath Ledger's [good acting but not really the] Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,Travis Bickle + Rupert Pupkin = Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,They went with the wrong costume. The red clown suit is reserved for the silver age of comics.
-_DJEzZk2pc,What happened to Jared Leto
-_DJEzZk2pc,From this I think they will have too much backstory and ruin the joker.  Rip Heathe Ledger.  Birthday tomorrow
-_DJEzZk2pc,Holy fucking Shit this looks good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Meh, still not sold."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm certainly going to check that out
-_DJEzZk2pc,I fucking hate superhero movies and this looks super sick
-_DJEzZk2pc,yuck
-_DJEzZk2pc,Will we see Joker gets his scars in this movie?
-_DJEzZk2pc,So he's basically doing half the Killing Joke book. Gotcha üëå He's WAY too old to be portraying that JOKER. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§£
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is gonna ruin it
-_DJEzZk2pc,So cool how he's coming to Smash Bros this month.
-_DJEzZk2pc,All it takes is one bad day <3
-_DJEzZk2pc,People who think this will be bad probably have more than one Michael Bay movie in their top 5 ü§£
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now I am interested
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks very interesting.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"1:50 jokes on you batman, HAHAHAHA"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now that's a Joker... Great job on this DC!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This is a ""version"" of the Joker, since he is so mysterious.  Think of Heath's joker how he always had a different story to tell about his scars and also from the game Batman : Arkham Origins, how the Joker says ""Sometimes I remember it one way, and other times another.""."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not a fan of it so far to be honest. No one in this world will ever come close to heath ledger. Call me nostalgic
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks good, but I don't think I want or need a Joker origin story."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"daniel day luis as batman, would been keen. Joker has Been portrayed in my eyes as correctly as possible by all actors. they took an aspect of him and ran with it. Phoenix is just lucky enough to be able to go full rage mode on this one."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I smell Oscar



Oscar, take a shower, or a tomato bath or something, please!

But seriously this looks great. It really captures the insanity of The Joker. Thank you so much for doing this movie!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can't wait!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix's Joker Laugh Is Perfect
-_DJEzZk2pc,Daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn
-_DJEzZk2pc,Captain Marvel looks way better then this trash
-_DJEzZk2pc,so is this before or after suicide squad? It feels like a prequel but with an older joker? I'm lost.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It kind of makes Joker look like a wimp, not at all bad ass, just weird and insane. Why would this guy ever be a match for Batman? I dont see it."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope that WB and DC notice the amount of positive attention this film is getting and keep it going with their next movies. This is what the fans want.
-_DJEzZk2pc,FINALLY! A redefining of The Joker. All Leto did was try to outdo Heath and end up looking like an edgy teenager. Phoenix is going to kill this!
-_DJEzZk2pc,A joker you can have sympathy for and understand his motives easier
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is better Jerome Valeska
-_DJEzZk2pc,just hoping that the film wont try to make joker into some kind of loveble underdog
-_DJEzZk2pc,"1:59 If Robert de Niro is in the film, can't be bad !!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This will suck
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please..... Please ...please be 90 percent as good as I want this to be.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This looks AMAZING. Can we please delete ""Damaged Joker"" from the DCU now?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""I used to think that my life was a tragedy, but now I realized, it's a comedy.""
- Joker 2019 -

Put on a Happy Face.
üòÄüòÑüòÜüòÖüòÅüòÇüòä"
-_DJEzZk2pc,üíØ Better than Letto
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I just hope the rest of the movie shows his descent into him becoming the joker in a good way. It seems to. It's like Anakin's descent to becoming Darth Vader rolled into one movie. I loved Juaquin in Walk the Line, Gladiator, Signs, and several others. He should have gotten awards for several of them.¬†This looks to do a credible job. I hope it does the back story justice. I WILL watch this. Take my money NOW!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is it about him getting beat up the whole movie?
-_DJEzZk2pc,What happened to Jarred Letto ??????
-_DJEzZk2pc,Cuando salen las gemas de la demencia
-_DJEzZk2pc,No batman ? Dc im dissaponited
-_DJEzZk2pc,Poor Jared Leto...sandwiched between Heath Ledger and Joaquin Phoenix. This dude right here. I mean he wanted to fuck a phone and had me empathizing. Acting chops on display.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not that kind of madness
-_DJEzZk2pc,Who else thinks that this Is a little creepy
-_DJEzZk2pc,This honestly looks so great. My excitement is through the roof.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This trailer says a lot about society
-_DJEzZk2pc,Awesome.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like ass tbh
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin phoenix is a mediocre actor at best. but he looks pretty dam good in this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,It is good but it doesn't feel like THE Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Cool trailer, where is Brian Callen in all of this tho"
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:01 would be awesome if that were Zsasz
-_DJEzZk2pc,"At 39 seconds that is called agonal breathing, the kinda shit that happens to people who are knocked out cold. He does it like its literally happening.

Fucking creepy."
-_DJEzZk2pc,My eye drops a tear. The stakes are too high.
-_DJEzZk2pc,LA MEJOR
-_DJEzZk2pc,Waiting........
-_DJEzZk2pc,All it takes is one bad day.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Im there!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC ü§¢
-_DJEzZk2pc,"the man on the tv that said that he is cold blooded was bruce waynes dad, at 1:50 the kid that the joker made smile was bruce wayne."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This seems like a good DC equivalent of Venom.
-_DJEzZk2pc,One bad day
-_DJEzZk2pc,Sorry but the second I heard Joaquin is going to be the lead I was sold! And watching this trailer I was right and I hope the movie turns out even more amazing then I had hoped!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is going to be one of the best movies of the year.
-_DJEzZk2pc,JOKER IS BACKKKKKKKKKK
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""the worst part of having a mental illness is

people expect you to behave as if you DONT"" - 0:26"
-_DJEzZk2pc,He looks more like the very first Joker from the Adam West era
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is he anerexic???
-_DJEzZk2pc,Just don‚Äôt be another Jared Leto scenario
-_DJEzZk2pc,Getting a Norman Bates vibe from Phoenix's Joker and it seems like it might work. Solid fucking trailer.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I find it quite sad üò¢
-_DJEzZk2pc,He did a fine as hell performance as johnny cash and this time around he is killing it again and that ain't no joke lol. can't wait too see this movie üëç
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm sitting on the fence with this one...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yeh
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh this is gonna be good
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks incredible.. still dont know how i feel about giving the joker a back story but in any case this looks killer.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is the strangest fucking most amazing thing I've seen üòÇüòÇüòÇ
-_DJEzZk2pc,"No se que tiene este trailer pero me hace conocer este personaje, osea es increible lo que transmite."
-_DJEzZk2pc,No sign of batman?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"i hope they still give him the mastermind background, with him knowing how to use chemicals and forming master plans"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"WOW!!!!!! I had no faith at all in Joaquin but after watching this I totally changed my mind! It blew me away!!!!!!!

Can't wait to watch it!!!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,this says a lot about our society
-_DJEzZk2pc,It def ain‚Äôt heath but I‚Äôll for sure take it. It‚Äôs unfair to put this against the greatest performance ever but This looks promising.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Good job DC, good job."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks really good. Wonder if he'll cut his cheeks or just paint em.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It's going to be a hard job to come close to Heath Ledger's Joker, but this looks real good and Joaquin Phoenix may be every bit as good if not better."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gamers rise up!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why didn't they use the story about him falling into a bunch of chemicals and being the red hood. But it seems to be a enjoyable movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Marvel is not laughing.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Lets put a smile on that face
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Its a ""holy shit"" flim if i ever seen one/."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh shit.
-_DJEzZk2pc,esse filme vai ser uma bosta puta que pariu pensei que n poderiam piorar o coringa mas conseguiram
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phenoix is going to give Heath Ledger a run for his money
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel so bad to joker because it is being shown that joker is a good guy before but because of the bad people of Gotham he became evil
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Ledger's Joker was like being served a fine meal... 
This looks like a lesson on how to prepare one. 

I can't wait to see it."
-_DJEzZk2pc,No one cared who i was until i put on the mask.
-_DJEzZk2pc,nice
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ouch! Marvel üë≠
-_DJEzZk2pc,Quietly this will be one of the best films of the year.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Oh my god. Dude, I love Heath Ledger and I felt like his joker was and is the best, but I'm really excited about this. Joaquin's joker actually gives me the creeps, and I can see how some people, if not everyone can relate to this character(Smile even when you're breaking) just by the trailer. I'm really looking forward to it!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Um... I think people are seeing something that is not there, this is not a good trailer and the film looks dull. Unless the ratings scream something special when it‚Äôs release I will stick to animated or Heath"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix man...
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Who wants to bet this is just the Joker telling one of his many origin stories to Harley Quinzel? Because, if you remember what he said in The Killing Joke, ""Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another. If I'm gonna have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice."""
-_DJEzZk2pc,watch the last part when he's riding on the elevator and pay close attention to his face. watch it a few times pause if you have to. he looks insane. truly diabolical.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"""All it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy."""
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hyyyyyyyyype
-_DJEzZk2pc,i can tell this joker is gonna be up there with heath ledger and mark hamill
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Yooooo, THAT LAUGH... HOLY FUCK! ;)))"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fucking genuis! 2020 best actor already!
-_DJEzZk2pc,OK DC! Steppin' up!!  YESS!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is an Oscar.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The first DC movie in a long time I'm excited about.
-_DJEzZk2pc,SOLD !! TAKE MY MONEY RIGHT NOW !!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"what an incredible trailer, best of the year so far and i'm bettin one of the best movies of the year 100% ..can't wait for it"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nothing beats the heath ledger joker. And this makeup looks hokey
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not the joker we want but the joker we need
-_DJEzZk2pc,What is DC's problem with ignoring hundreds and hundreds of bad ass DC villains and keep doing the same characters?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"DC May have an Oscar Winner for Best Picture next year. This was done so well, Joaquin Phoenix is Amazing as the Joker. I didn't think Heath Ledger could be eclipsed."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Less than 3 minutes and I guarantee one Oscar's nomination.
-_DJEzZk2pc,He has to be better than  jared Leto
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Please, DC! PLEASE, Shazman and this trailer please let it be true, be better than marvel. I CANT WAIT TO WATCH THIS SPIRAL INTO INSANITY"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why is he giving his mother a bath?! Lol 0:20
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is the Joker that Ben Affleck's Batman deserved.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Thought they were dropping the ball with this with early looks and the photos and behind the scenes... I STAND CORRECTED... Never doubt Joquain... Ill be on line opening day.. A true character analysis.. Grounded drama.. All it takes is one bad day... Will Zazie beats become his harley.. She smiled big for a reason
-_DJEzZk2pc,I dont get it
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This state of this present world could put a smile on anyone's face. And, by *smile* I mean this world could drive anyone over the edge. 


*Let's put a smile on that face*"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Man i was *smiling* when i saw this trailer, its strange that i *smile* when i watch a DC trailer"
-_DJEzZk2pc,October though? Ugh...‚Ä¶ I want it NOW
-_DJEzZk2pc,Seems like a bit of a pussy I want to see him brutally dismantle the people who abused him
-_DJEzZk2pc,Love it insanity at its finest
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why so SERRiousssss  ???  TAKE ME MONEYYYYY   !!!  Me life is a comedy  ....
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks boring
-_DJEzZk2pc,Breathe Magenis! I love this trailer!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Not bad or good, but sure is interesting....yep. now I have to see this. xD"
-_DJEzZk2pc,T√° muito pica mano pqp
-_DJEzZk2pc,"His thoughts: 
forget who you are
Forget why you're here
Forget your happiness
Be crazy and laugh about it"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I also like how there being happy music to a sad story seems like an anecdote to his character. He's depressed, broken and tortured but overshadows this superficially by smiling and laughing"
-_DJEzZk2pc,That laugh is sinister.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Been there a time or two
-_DJEzZk2pc,I miss heath ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,I had a little more hope. But still the movie could be better than the trailer
-_DJEzZk2pc,omgggg I hope this turns out amazing
-_DJEzZk2pc,That‚Äôs looks amazing
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Woah, DC actually made a good movie"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm actually, so stoked for this film. My expectations for it have been very high and it still managed to exceed them in this trailer. His character seems innocent and maybe autistic. He just wants to see other people happy but it gets abused by this chaotic world, his sense of order will be shattered to chaos, I imagine. There's so many things I love about this. Can't rave about it hard enough"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please don't suck. Please don't suck. Pleeeeeaaaaassssseeeee....
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin Phoenix is one of the greatest actors ever!
This film will be fucking awesome."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wow. What a beautifully, deeply haunting take on the Joker. October can‚Äôt come fast enough!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Bruh this gave me chills
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is so unlike the original. Where's the grills? The 'damaged' tattoo? The pimp jewellery? Pyjama trousers? And why is he actually laughing instead of making noises a baby makes when it's hungry?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Please be good, pleeeeease be good üôèüèª"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Interesting...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Masterpiece loading.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"okay, not gonna lie.  I am freaking impressed.  Holy shit.  And no, not because the joker is a straight white male either.  Or that I'm a toxic masculine, homophobic, sexist, racist."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm a MCU fan but this is OFF THE HOOK!! Can't wait!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gamers rise up.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Too soon for Oscar buzz? I don't think so. This looks human, sad, incredibly scary..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Terrible. Heath Ledger will never be touched.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This character development shown in a trailer is second to none. Can't wait for this!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Its looking real good, and I'll watch it for sure.. But what I really want to see is Willem Dafoe's Joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Gonna be the best Joker ever!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"IT SUBVERTED MY EXPECTATIONS, VERY COOL.
I CLAPPED WHEN I SAW THE JOKER"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Absolutely beautiful. Can‚Äôt wait to see this! Heath would be proud
-_DJEzZk2pc,This actually makes the joker freaky
-_DJEzZk2pc,this movie will be wack
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like a remake of taxi driver. A spiral to madness
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's going to be another terrible DC movie!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Magnum Opus of Mr. Phoenix!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The hype is strong, Phoenix will rock us!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It's beautiful when a movie doesn't have CGI, the story is the important."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I get a slight the shining vibe from this, certainly not complaining"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Soooo... does this fit into the DCEU or is it just another DC film?
-_DJEzZk2pc,This look amazing
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ehh

-_DJEzZk2pc,1:55 to 2:02 that rise in the music gives me chills
-_DJEzZk2pc,That was waaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy better than I expected lmfao
-_DJEzZk2pc,The kid at 1:51 is young Bruce Wayne
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks good
-_DJEzZk2pc,The thing that puts the DC universe apart from the Marvel universe is the DC universe is so fucking dark
-_DJEzZk2pc,We live in society
-_DJEzZk2pc,I like the look of everything except when he randomly gets bullied and beat up by people which looked really silly and reminded me of sterotypical american kids being bullied scenes in films
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:53 I have a feeling that this is our Bruce Wayne
-_DJEzZk2pc,whoooooo... I LIKE this MADNESS.. HAHAHAHAHA
-_DJEzZk2pc,So this has to be a hard R right??? Right??
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Gamer Movie! Finally, some representation!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,That little boy... could be Bruce.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Damn Joaquin, that Joker is awesome - great job.
Didnt ever think i would see a good insane portrael of the joker other than Heaths.
SOLD - DC take my money."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"My god what did I just see!! Could this be a master of his craft pushing the elements of possibility with method acting. I can see this movie with Oscar all over it, magic on the screen. Thank you Joaquin!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Guys, I don't wanna be a downer but Brie Larson will probably beat Joaquin for the Oscars. That shit is ricked"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"First image: this sucks 
Leaked photos: u have my attention 
Teaser trailer: FUCK YEA!!!!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Omfg he's gonna kill it
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks like absolute trash
-_DJEzZk2pc,This doesnt even look like a movie. This looks like a fever dream
-_DJEzZk2pc,What better person to play the joker than someone who spends his life pulling jokes on the world.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This better be good!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can't wait!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Seeing personally one of my favorite actors become one of my favorite villains is a dream come true
-_DJEzZk2pc,01:52  bruce wayne ...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Let‚Äôs hope he is as good as heath ledger but still heath will still be king
-_DJEzZk2pc,My prayers have been Heard!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is going to be the most iconic role of his career
-_DJEzZk2pc,Endgame who?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It's odd how all the comments are so extremely positive...  
*Checks IMDB*
***No mention of Zach Snyder***


Ah Ha!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Give him the Oscar already
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I have to watch it but not based on this trailer, it doesn't hook."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This shit look awful üòêü§£
-_DJEzZk2pc,What does he say at the end of u just ???
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If they do an origins movie for Freddy Krueger, cast Joaquin Phoenix."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"What I would like to see is multiple ‚Äújoker‚Äù movies with potentially all different background stories. Based on the joker quote ‚Äúif I had a past, it would be multiple choice‚Äù."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Damn, The Joker as come a long way since Cesar Romero.üåª"
-_DJEzZk2pc,That laugh is AWESOME!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks incredible
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Tremendo,awesome..!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope this film delivers his story and I think they have a great joker in Joaquin just based on J's old work. I think hes never let me down. dude is a very talented actor!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Is this an alternated joker story cause I don‚Äôt see anything that follows the origins of the joker , don‚Äôt take this as a negative comment so far I like what I see , but I feel like I miss something on my comic books days"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is he going to fall in the ace chemicals thingy again? If not I‚Äôm not watching
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope the movie comes out well! Amazing character development. That's like wow! Joaquin was meant to be the Joker. üí£üí£üí£üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•
-_DJEzZk2pc,this looks fantastic. We shall see.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I hope this movie is like an DC adaptation of Taxi Driver.  In that film, we brilliantly see a man - who was already on the edge - slowly and convincingly descend into someone who is criminally insane.  Taxi Driver didn't need to rely on cheap theatrics to make it work.  The Joker is one of the best villains in American folklore.  He's funny, diabolical, brilliant, cunning, insane, bizarre, and terrifying. I hope this everyone involved in this creation of this film can make this work."
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's a work of art how the music goes from happy and hopeful to a dark doomful tone. Eager to watch this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This could be the best joker yet...
-_DJEzZk2pc,I thought Joaquin Phoenix died?  He's still alive??
-_DJEzZk2pc,They better not fuck this one up
-_DJEzZk2pc,why do i have goose bumps?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"‚ÄúActually, I was fighting this caped badass, until I found out that his mom is also named Martha‚Äù"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks beautiful
-_DJEzZk2pc,Paper boy!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I actually think this is good but it reminds me more of Norman bateman then the guy who fights someone in a bat costume
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This might be a Amazing Movie.
I feel like I'm watching a movie about the Joker the insanity in his eyes as he spirals down"
-_DJEzZk2pc,before 1M views
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why so serious?!
-_DJEzZk2pc,October can not get here soon enough
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks really good. Can't wait to see it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hope Harley is in this
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks a bit poo poo ngl
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hope its good. But seriously Batman wont even break a sweat putting his ass in Arkham Asylum
-_DJEzZk2pc,what is the song that starts at 1:28
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Yeah, this got me wet and I don't even have a vagina. JOAQUIN IS THE GOAT!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"No tattoos, no grill, no six pack. Creepy as hell, big shoes to fill but my god has built up some credit with this trailer"
-_DJEzZk2pc,He is jokestar of earth 3
-_DJEzZk2pc,"the joker we need, not the one we deserve"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Everthing must go. Sanity? ü§î
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC has let us down consistently. Lord don‚Äôt let them fuck this one up. Also rip heath the best joker to ever do it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This trailer showed 0 action. How can anyone be excited?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why so serious?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please please please..don‚Äôt disappoint usüòê
-_DJEzZk2pc,despite being only 13% of the population
-_DJEzZk2pc,"1:53 - 2:07 Tommy Wiseau, The Room. :D"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Eh, that was...underwhelming. Though I‚Äôll still try to keep an open mind till I see it"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Because I'm the joker, baby!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,DAMN this looks good
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker nerf ü§£
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dude this actually looks like its going to be fucking great
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This version reminds me of Walter White a little bit, going from a total loser to a criminal mastermind."
-_DJEzZk2pc,based on what has come before this isn't much of a leap.  The dark knight's joker is still the gold standard.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If this movie works, I am willing to forgive that uninspiring and very silly DC universe with Ben Affleck . Am I not merciful? 






AM I NOT MERCIFUL?!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This trailer put a smile in my face. Now Im always smiling.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Whats the soundtrack for this trailer ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Sheesh. I wanted to see this movie, but after this trailer, I don't think I'm mature enough. Well done."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Trailer released today.?!! 
I would bet it is a Tribute to the legend Heath Andrew Ledger who was born today on 1979 ‚Äì 22 January 2008"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"am i trippin‚Äô or does joaquin phoenix look like a older david mazouz..






now i want to see a 6th season of gotham - ‚ÄúBat becomes Clown‚Äù"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Wait, is the Joker the supervillain with the most portrayals?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Best villain ever
-_DJEzZk2pc,it looks so gritty and creepy Joaquin phoenix is meant to be the joker i love his laugh
-_DJEzZk2pc,I honestly will be surprised if Phoenix doesn't win an Oscar for this. I love how even his posture changes from hunched over to straightened up and confident.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yes...this is the Joker we never knew that we needed.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"oh, yeah, now this a comic book movie. fuck zack snyder"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nahhhhh. I think I'll wait until there's a good Joker movie again.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Whack.
-_DJEzZk2pc,No thanks.  No hype train for me.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Literally the only films trailer that made me want to see a film in about 3 years
-_DJEzZk2pc,Phil Dunphy is a crazy good joker smh
-_DJEzZk2pc,"From an artistic aspect this movie looks amazing. From the fan I am of anything Batman (who in my opinion has some of the most complicated characters and villains) I must see this movie. Now get ready to see the best rendition of Joker, sorry Heath."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"While I still believe that the Joker is the one origin story that shouldn't be told, I have to admit this looks great."
-_DJEzZk2pc,y‚Äôall haven‚Äôt even seen the movie yet and already saying oscar
-_DJEzZk2pc,?Batman? 1:44
-_DJEzZk2pc,Never have I been so excited for a movie!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I almost feel bad for this Joker.

Great acting!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where's Batman?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I fucking hate superhero movies but this looks fucking amazing
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm a little confused, what are they trying to go for here?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,HOLY FUCK THIS LOOKS GREAT!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I cried watching his performance
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This seems promising. Personally I like it more, that so far you don't know who the joker is and why he is that way. But it still looks promising"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I love how you can see his body language evolve in this trailer. Especially at the end when he‚Äôs fully loose. 

Also the soundtrack better live up to the excellent cinematography like this trailer did."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,"0:17-0:45 
I feel so bad for him :("
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I was unsure about this movie but after watching this, I can say that I'm 100% on board. Can't wait!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where the hell is Donald Glover and Lakeith Stanfield?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Who the fuck asked for a fucking joker movie!?! What the fuck!?!?
-_DJEzZk2pc,oscar
-_DJEzZk2pc,"shit !!

-_DJEzZk2pc,"I like it,but the joker is a genius with a massive IQ this kinda portrays him as a simpleton."
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:51 he makes the batman smile (little Bruce wayne)
-_DJEzZk2pc,oh hell yes
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally a Joker who is worthy to follow Ledgers steps
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I know why they waited two extra days to release this... Because if they released it on the 1st, it would have went down as the worst april fool of all time... 
Fucking hopeless..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yes
-_DJEzZk2pc,this is the joker for reals lets get this dc come on we need another win wonder woman was good well skip aquaman
-_DJEzZk2pc,I was waiting to hear his joker laugh and I was not disappointed
-_DJEzZk2pc,"All it takes...
Is one bad day."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Yes!!! Finally, a new generation DC movie I can look forward to."
-_DJEzZk2pc,El Guas√≥n!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Better than leto
-_DJEzZk2pc,This doesn't even look like joker or how his origin started
-_DJEzZk2pc,Our generation's greatest
-_DJEzZk2pc,This film looks fantastic ü•Åüòòüåª.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"WOAH! Major creep-factor! 
This does put a smile on my face."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I was excited and hoping for more, I don't know IT SUCKS"
-_DJEzZk2pc,THIS IS WHAT THE PEOPLE WANTED DC FINALLY

-_DJEzZk2pc,OMG!! Amazing!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can‚Äôt fucking wait
-_DJEzZk2pc,"They was his Joker looks and acts is scary and off-putting. I loved Health Ledger as The Joker, and I am looking forward to seeing Joaquin Phoenix's version!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,You did it again DC. bringing out a crap movie... this will bomb. I guarantee it
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope the movie is better than the trailer. This joker just doesn't look as crazy as the one in suicide squad.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oscar for best movie for the second time goes to the Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,I cant wait till this drops
-_DJEzZk2pc,OMG this is beautiful! Finally!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I have high expectations of this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh my GOD This is the best version of joker ever! Joaquin always embodies the most realistic version of any character and the director Tod Philips seems to have made a masterpiece! this movie is gonna be fantastic!! hope every Joker fan or every Batman fan enjoy it!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks awful
-_DJEzZk2pc,Amazing
-_DJEzZk2pc,"what about the sacrs?
and what about ""my drunk dady story""?
what about the ""why so serious"" line that is usual on a joker?

im in love with this movie allready, don't take me wrong, i just feel that they changed a story that was planned perfectly.
i love the joker's orignal story just sad...

but this movie, this one, i feel it's gona ""put a smile on my face"" if u know what i mean"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This could be amazing or terrible. I'm hoping amazing?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Now now then suicide squad had a brilliant trailer and well look how that turned out!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Batman: ‚Äúis any of that true‚Äù?
Joker: *smiles*

*roll credit*"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The trailer starts and ends with the stair case, first gloomy then of course ‚Äúhappy‚Äù"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Holy shit I'm so excited!! Havent been hyped for a DC movie in awhile! (Is the affliated with DC? Like the DCEU?) Anyways just from the trailer this Joker makes me feel uneasy and a little terrified!! So excited!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Dc wants to sell movies but they change their actors every movie possible
-_DJEzZk2pc,I bet the kid in 1:51 is Bruce Wayne
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Oscar vibes, Thank You Joaquin"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Jared Leto has left the chat.
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC is back mofuckers.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like he had more than just one bad day. Can't wait to see this guy going on a killing spree!
-_DJEzZk2pc,DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMN
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Finally, a movie deserve to watch"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaqu√≠n is Puerto Rican....wonder if Trump will be throwing paper towels at the premier .......üáµüá∑üáµüá∑üáµüá∑üáµüá∑üáµüá∑

-_DJEzZk2pc,I would have rather seen Jared Leto‚Äôs Joker have a movie.. I don‚Äôt know how I feel about this one.
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC has finally lost its way.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally a movie for GAMERS
-_DJEzZk2pc,...oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy...
-_DJEzZk2pc,OMG I AM ALL IN ON THIS
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks good !
-_DJEzZk2pc,Se ve que va a estar bien mierdas pero no por la actuaci√≥n (eso se ve bien)
-_DJEzZk2pc,He's not the Joker that DC deserves but he's the Joker that DC needs!
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:50. That is a young Bruce wyane so Batman so we're going to get the joker killing the wyanes in this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC after countless bad movies: Let's put a smile on that face!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks good, but if they mess up again one of the most promising and one of the best storylines in comic world than they should shut the whole industry down"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is the cold blooded act the murder of Bruce Wayne's parents and is that a young Bruce Wayne at 1:50?
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is what DC movies supposed to be!
-_DJEzZk2pc,will Batman apear in it?
-_DJEzZk2pc,now this looks deep
-_DJEzZk2pc,I see potential for greatness in this movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Everyone is talking about how this movie is perfect. Just wait till it comes out
-_DJEzZk2pc,they better not fuck this up because it looks good.
-_DJEzZk2pc,just wow wow wow.  Joaquin Phoenix give justice to the role of joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,J O A Q U I N !
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Heath Ledger wouldn‚Äôt be as loved by all you fan boys if he hadn‚Äôt died. Same as every artist that was hated before their passing. Heath was great, but how about you shut the fuck up and let the role evolve into more than a lip licking criminal mastermind with no origin story? If he hadn‚Äôt died, half of you wouldn‚Äôt even like him"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It been a while since I have been exited for a film like I feel exited for this one. Man, I loved everything so far. I've played the final scene as he turns the hallway over and over, he just looks so damn scary :o"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin's Scorpiesque personality portrays this quintessential role.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This I think we can honestly say, we've all been waiting for, he woulda been my nxt choice after ledger hands down. But I've been a Phoenix fan since Signs"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Interesting....the same director of The Hangover movies made this
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yes! Heath Ledger is back!
-_DJEzZk2pc,The painted mask is not good at all
-_DJEzZk2pc,this is trash. i effing hate myself
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think we are going to see the best joker so far
-_DJEzZk2pc,not feeling this
-_DJEzZk2pc,Honestly the last shot of him really brought me back to seeing Heath Ledger's performance for the first time. Complete chills.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not a fan of the suit and face paint but looks okay
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow ! Joaquin Phoenix is one of the best method actors out there. Look at his freaking body and motion. God damn.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Meh.
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:43 best vacum I have ever seen.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Very interested
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin Phoenix
The Oscar is waiting

Unbelievable trailer; you can tell the movie going to be super amazing

After falling in love with Heath Ledger as Joker; I never thought that one day someone will come and play the Joker as good as Heath"
-_DJEzZk2pc,this is going to be awesome.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"not bad, but Lego Batman‚Äôs Joker is better :)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Heres a pretty meme.....the joker actually wears make up
-_DJEzZk2pc,Seems like they finally got the silver age joker fixed.
-_DJEzZk2pc,PERSONA!
-_DJEzZk2pc,a nightmare for marvels fans
-_DJEzZk2pc,meh
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC planing on a good movie ? Checked the date
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:85 ratio ? I would like it but mdb tells 2:39 :/
-_DJEzZk2pc,The Joker is a school shooter.  The worst in society created the Joker the same way that the bullying students create the school shooter.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"And THAT""S how it done Jared Leto!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Hopefully Ben asslick doesn't appear as Batman, and ruin the whole movie."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I've never laugh so good HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
-_DJEzZk2pc,thats about the only actor that has the talent to pull this off.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Young Bruce Wayne 1:51
-_DJEzZk2pc,Cleaver move by DC. Can‚Äôt wait to see Joaquin ripping the shit out of this character!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin is going to Kill it... He is amazing and this was made for him... cant wait
-_DJEzZk2pc,This Joker actually feels like it could be anyone of u... i'm super excited!
-_DJEzZk2pc,now THIS is a film I want to see
-_DJEzZk2pc,This seems unsettling!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I se a lot of similarities between his acting and Heath Ledgers, this really looks sick. Take my money."
-_DJEzZk2pc,This joker looked promising
-_DJEzZk2pc,No excitement at all in this trailer that gets me up and would want to watch it but they did choose the right character
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:26 that laugh üòçüòÅ
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why aren't you laughing?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I was afraid the trailer would be nothing but explosions and special effects thank God there's an actual story
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The actor gets a role which he always deserved!

Finally!!!!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think I'm gonna like this.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Does it look promising? Yes. But a 2:41 trailer isn't enough to say it's going to do the character justice. We will know that in 8 months.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Whaah gotham returns the train the people the filthy road the Joker ..
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:52 what‚Äôs the kids name? Irl
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Maybe, JUST maybe, what if, Joaquin actually gives us a better Joker than Heath Ledger?! HOLDIT RIGHTTHERE!!!! This doesn't mean Heaths legacy is damaged.
I just mean maybe, it could be possible that somehow, someone (maybe Joaquin)  will do EVEN better. I think he will actually, and I hope everyone hopes to see such an incredible improvement."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"When life beats you hard enough, you break."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow this REALLY Looks GOOD

-_DJEzZk2pc,"He should've been in the DCEU...
I take that back..... The DCEU doesn't deserve this joker imo"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker reborn....
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think a lot of people could relate to this movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can‚Äôt stop watching this trailer. He‚Äôs going to Kill This role !!! I can‚Äôt effing wait !!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,102 people don't know how to laugh
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Time to laugh, Gotham, want some fish?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks like another chance for DC to embarrass themselves. Like a comic book movie made for not comic book readers but people who soap operas. No thanks.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It will be interesting to see how this love letter to Scorsese‚Äôs and Di‚ÄôNiro‚Äôs 70‚Äôs movies are interrupted through a familiar villain.  Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and the King of Comedy in one script."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Rest in peace Heath ledger, no one will ever take your place in this universe..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I Hope this is not real! the actor is not good! To old
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This, Looks fucking stupid.."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Eh I don't know, it looks interesting, so who knows."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I smell an Oscar right here
-_DJEzZk2pc,Atlanta feat. The Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Magical reincarnation of the role. Heath wound be proud, all of us as well."
-_DJEzZk2pc,yes this the joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Q.What happens to everyone who plays a soldier in PREDATOR?
A.They become Governor at some point in their life.
Q.What happens to everyone who plays the JOKER?
A.They win an Oscar at some point in their life."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks boring af
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC coming through!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh my tits... Batman!
-_DJEzZk2pc,he has a super good voice for the role tho.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I'm afraid is gonna be another suicide squad movie, started just like it, trailer was so promising and full movie end up being so bad, shall we give it the benefit of the doubt??? I guess I'm still gonna wait for it..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Music is wow
-_DJEzZk2pc,I'm in.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The faster the music the closer to insanity the Joker is. At the end, the music is calmer and slower but that in way that freaks me out"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôm smelling an Oscar !!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks amazing. Joaquin one of the few actors on the planet who could do this role justice
-_DJEzZk2pc,"i literally had chills
joaquin would be as amazing as heath was and i think this will turn out even better!
music is as wonderful as it can get
this is one of the most satisfying trailer i've watched so far!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This actually looks goods and enjoyable? I am shocked and very happy.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Most loved Villain of all time
-_DJEzZk2pc,And the Oscar go Joaqu√≠n Phoenix for JOKER i love its so look amacing ¬°Oh my Good!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC is really improving
-_DJEzZk2pc,At 31 k
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks too good to be true..bet the 1 comic book movie you REALLY want to see is gona get cancelled
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally something good in this year
-_DJEzZk2pc,Snyder isn't involved so I'm sold.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Meh not getting hyped and will just have to wait and see really they need to slow down with these DC movies
-_DJEzZk2pc,WOW! ART!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Not a fan of the costume. It's not bad, if you put it next to Heath Ledger's costume it looks like someone turned on the mirror matches in a fighting game."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Well, it looks good, but I'll state the obvious. Joaquin Phoenix will have to pull out all the stops, employ every drop of talent he possesses, to top Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker. But I'll keep an open mind until I see the film."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I hope they don‚Äôt mess up the Wayne family in this movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,this is going a to be a great flick
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks awesome, but nobody can ever top heath ledgers joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Trash
-_DJEzZk2pc,I kind of hope that they didn't skimp on violence.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"üî•Mixed feelings :
Phoenix is a great actor, but Heath has set a benchmark character play.
Well, still not sympathising with the #JOKER !üî•"
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:51 - that has to be Bruce Wayne :D
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I don't know. Like really. I have no idea. IS it good for the Joker to have an origin story while what we like is exactly the lack of information from the Joker ? Hmmm .... Could be amazingly amazing, could be even worst than Jared Leto's Joker. Let's figure this out in theater :)"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not liking it.    Looks trash
-_DJEzZk2pc,*This gave me chills in a way I cant describe*
-_DJEzZk2pc,Holy smokes!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Hey Leto...eat a LITERAL DICK!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Holy. Fucking.Shit. This is not what I expected at all. This is so much better!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why is this not #1 on trending ?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Am I the only one who is going to actually acknowledge how shit this film looks? He looks nothing like the Joker (his jacket and pants are not purple, his make-up doesn‚Äôt look right etc). As far as I‚Äôm aware, the Joker has never had a back story, so this is not a comic book story, which is what the DCEU is trying to do, from my understanding. It would be nice to chose one actor to play a character and keep it that way. I actually liked Jared Leto, as I think he brought a madness to the role, and Heath Ledger brought the insanity. Put those two together and you have yourself the perfect Joker. Let‚Äôs hope ‚ÄòBirds of Prey‚Äô is going to be better. At least they can keep an actor playing the same role in more than one movie (Margo Robbie as Harley Quinn)."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Omg
-_DJEzZk2pc,Picked the perfect actor for this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,Its Johnny Cash!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This makes Letos joker look so much worse than it already was.God wtf were they thinking with that character.This movie doesn‚Äôt just look like a good Joker movie,looks like a brilliant movie!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,shit this looks amazing
-_DJEzZk2pc,I want to see it now... wow
-_DJEzZk2pc,Has he done it... Has he actually triumphed and made the most emotional joker ever!!! He ain't ledger but hands down a marvelous performance!!! üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Where is the tongue, when he smile? 
Joker never never never have had a lozenge over the eyes!

I think he is an good actor, and the story too, but the mask and some other missed details destroy this  great classic DC Figure."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Im tired about superheroes comedy movies? (marvel) this is what we deserve !!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Y'know, I was on the fence for this one, but this trailer made me want to see it.  And Pheonix looks fucking awesome."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Finally Heath Ledger will rest in peace
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Everytime its like sisyphus climbing thos stairs it seems. Yet when he becomes the joker its as if he says ""fuck the rock"" and is liberated by rock bottom. Which shows when he adopted the joker (or became?) persona, which is why he is dancing down the stairs."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ok. I'm with it
-_DJEzZk2pc,Rumors are that it‚Äôs gonna be a pretty hard ‚ÄúR‚Äù rating. Pumped... as... hell.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"may you get an Oscar for this,Joaquin ??"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Why do people fall for the same exact trailer every time. This looks awful, it's basically saying he got beaten up so he will become Joker. I hope the movie isn't garbage like this trailer."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin Phoenix is an amazing actor, this gonna be good"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Can someone tell me which the music of the trailer?
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is something I wouldn't mind paying to watch.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"joker kills bruce's parents.
1:50 this kid is bruce
1:34 he has a gun and guy in tv is talking about death of bruce's parents"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Movie looks absolutely incredible.  Still don't like the look lol.  It's really not that hard to nail down something as iconic as classic Joker.  Cosplayers do it with great effectiveness daily.  As good as this looks, though, that's a small nitpick from me.  This could potentially blow Nicholson and Ledger away."
-_DJEzZk2pc,It's looks beautiful but I have to look at this as a else world story. DC really don't get their heroes and villians.
-_DJEzZk2pc,The JOKER... making DC movies great again!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Im smiling
-_DJEzZk2pc,This actually seems promising! üòç
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks great.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Well it looks better than Batman vs Superman i suppose.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is bad movie making. DC is done.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"The way he‚Äôs dancing with the sign, the immediate face that he makes after talking his fingers out of his mouth, the way he jumps down the steps, the laugh he chose, the bones sticking out of his back from the 50 pounds he lost.. Its going to be special. If anyone can stand up with Ledger, it‚Äôs Joaquin."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Not exactly the back story I was hoping for but I‚Äôm definitely going to see it, cinematography looks incredible"
-_DJEzZk2pc,I got goosebumps watching this and anticipating watching the performance of Joaquin as joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This looks like garbage,  I won't be paying to see this, won't watch it for free, and I wouldn't watch it if they paid me."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"im skeptical about a joker origin story, since his origin is supposed to be unknown, but this does look really interesting, and a refreshing take on the ""superhero"" character stories. im excited"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"YASS LIFE IS JUST A COMEDY, YASSS YAAASSS IT IS TRUE ü§£ü§£"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Lets hope the movie doesnt turn out a joke
-_DJEzZk2pc,"i thought Heath Ledger was Awesome then I see this and WHOA! can't wait to see it. i Like, OLE!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,joaquin phoenix cannot possibly be THIS GOOD
-_DJEzZk2pc,"It looks beautiful,in a way."
-_DJEzZk2pc,That laugh... just captured the Joker in pure form. Love it!
-_DJEzZk2pc,The Joaqer.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Is it just me, or is it getting crazier outt there"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Please be awesome please be awesome please be awesome please be awesome please be awesome please be awesome...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Masterpiece!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Fuck yeah
-_DJEzZk2pc,Surely the best one that we are gonna have with heath ledger
-_DJEzZk2pc,"and the Oscar goes to Joaquin Phoenix, if Heath Ledger were alive he'd deliver it to him."
-_DJEzZk2pc,If the DC universe was like this instead if how it is now I'm sure it be doing alot better
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow. Just wow.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks awful. Good acting sure. But what is this supposed to be. A one off film i guess
-_DJEzZk2pc,Holy shit!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Comparisons with Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger are inevitable. Heath's Joker will always stand out .
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joker without Batman is like bread without butter, this film will bomb, I presume it will flop miserably."
-_DJEzZk2pc,exactly what they needed. Real question is will he be in any other movie.? DC change characters to much.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Only slightly better than Leto's.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"can not stand all the super hero movies, BUt this looks very special. Will be seeing this opening night."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This kind of reminds me of the Micheal Douglas Movie ""FALLING DOWN""  
Just a hard working guy thats been pushed to and beyond his limits so he snaps."
-_DJEzZk2pc,That revolver he had is probably going to be used to murder bruces parents he obviously has a beef with the Wayne's
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Looks interesting. The song is Smile by Nat King Cole. Very reminiscent of the mood created by Nat King Cole's Unforgettable in Watchmen"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Epic! Makes me want to become a villain lol! The color scheme/cinematography of this movie is great, very 70's. This will be great!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Where are all the dead bodies?
-_DJEzZk2pc,WHOA.  SEEING IT.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Release the crazy!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,As Kevin Smith would say take my money. This looks like it is going to be something completely different than anything we have seen in this genre on film ever. It looks like DC deciding to say screw it and just let every filmmaker do their own thing after what happen with JL is going to pay off.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Get this man a dceu contract!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"still dont like the idea of giving joker an idintity and makes batman weak. imagin joker had possessed an idintity that simple wife kid bla bla bla and batman the best ditective couldnt solve that?. and what about all speaches that joker gives about his wife and father? we all know those are lies for just him to manipulate their victims or play with them. this movie is great but giving joker an idintity is wrong wrong wrong, joker must be mystery."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Take my money and soul.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Is this going to be rated R? Cause I would be cool with that ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks great
-_DJEzZk2pc,"erm...... NO.  what is this crap?`when I wanna see THE joker, I'll watch GOTHAM... to see Cameron Monaghan."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Es hermoso üòç

Saludos desde Per√∫ üáµüá™"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yes...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Amazing. Will totally see this! Oscar (c) level acting.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not a fan of Phoenix but I will watch this
-_DJEzZk2pc,The comment section in a dc movie trailer never looked so optimistic about a movie.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This literally looks so stupid. Like so so so stupid.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"01:49 - The young boy is confirmed to be a young Bruce Wayne/Batman, played by child actor Dante Pereira-Olson.
I LOVE the fact The Joker interacts with a little Bruce Wayne forcing him to ‚Äúsmile‚Äù and ‚Äúput on a happy face‚Äù,  just like what happened to the Joker when his Mother told him too. And he grew up to become psychologically and sociologically disturbed & challenged by everything around him. Just like Bruce Wayne will. 
This movie showcases the parallel nature of both The Joker and Bruce Wayne/Batman who are seen destined to become poor psychologically disturbed souls. Bruce already being affected by his interaction with The Joker. 
I love the fact that this film is a psychological character study of The Joker and how this also going to affect Bruce Wayne eventually becoming The Batman. 
I haven‚Äôt been this excited since Christopher Nolan‚Äôs The Dark Knight trilogy."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Song in the background?
-_DJEzZk2pc,mhe
-_DJEzZk2pc,Great trailer as usual from DC. Finish product will be shit garanteed.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Didn't realize De Niro was in it..
-_DJEzZk2pc,Omg I cant wait looks like a beautiful twisted tale so PUMPED October please hurry
-_DJEzZk2pc,"this is such  great trailer. it gives me an eerie vibe and makes me cry at some points, I feel like I am actually experiencing what joker is going through. touching. these are the movies we need"
-_DJEzZk2pc,0:12 .. and thats me gripped!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,I‚Äôm speechless ü•Ä
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I can see Joaquin doing just as good as Heath did! This already looks oscar worthy, Its mind boggling."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"monsters wasn't born, they were created. sad"

-_DJEzZk2pc,"I see a picture of Collin Trevorow in my head. When I heard the song "" Smile"" and I dont know why ?"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Woooo a real joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,whoa this trailer gives me goose bumps!
-_DJEzZk2pc,De niro
-_DJEzZk2pc,This one is going to be a tearjerker won't it?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Not feeling it
-_DJEzZk2pc,Won't top Ledger. Sorry s0yb0ys
-_DJEzZk2pc,so Joker's Name is Arthur.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joker without Batman? I'm not to sure about this one. Heath Ledger was by far the most accurate depiction of Joker. Joaquin is great, but nowhere phenomenal as Heath."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I remember watching the Dark Knight and loving Heath Ledger before I even knew who he was. I was so heartbroken when I realised he had passed away many years ago at that point.  

A couple months ago, I was watching a video where Christopher Nolan was talking  about Heath Ledger's dedication to the Joker and how he wanted to do a backstory for the crazy character.  Sadly, Heath never got that chance. 

So I think that he is definitely looking down from the heavens and smiling down at Joaquin Phoenix with pride in his eyes. For the simple reason that from the trailer alone, it is clear to see that Joaquin's dedication to the Joker is second to Heath only. 

Love you and miss you every day, Heath Ledger, now at peace. ‚ù§"
-_DJEzZk2pc,So is that his wife that he‚Äôs with?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Lets be honest, without Heath Ledger's ""Joker"", this movie does not get made."
-_DJEzZk2pc,There will never be a better Joker than Heath Ledger. Joaquin Phoenix: Hold my exploding whoopee cushion.
-_DJEzZk2pc,fan tastic
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks great
-_DJEzZk2pc,It‚Äôs not a superhero movie ........ it‚Äôs a super villain movie love the vibe its giving
-_DJEzZk2pc,Looks horrible.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nailed the laugh!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Why so........... serious? 

Naw im scared Mr Joaquin"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks good
-_DJEzZk2pc,I love his laugh
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joaquin Phoenix is underrated AF. He should have won the Academy for Walk the Line, The Master and Gladiator by now. 

Dude murders every role he is in."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Im from 2020 this movie sucks
-_DJEzZk2pc,Well.............. That sucked
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think the best dc movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,why is everyone so impressed...
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wtf? In the animation he had a pregnant wife? What‚Äôs this?
-_DJEzZk2pc,I always knew Joker had a story to tell.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker was created because of the people of Gotham. Who‚Äôs the real criminal:/
-_DJEzZk2pc,Best actor for the role !!
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC's Villans are better then the superheros
-_DJEzZk2pc,I think joker wasn't joking about getting two oscars
-_DJEzZk2pc,wouw
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix offered more in these three minutes than Jared Leto in the entire movie. Though I doubt he will top Heath Ledger who found the perfect balance between insanity and a criminal mastermind
-_DJEzZk2pc,"We don't need to worry about, we lossed Ledger. We got theee best version. The brand new joker."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Give the man an Oscar already....that opening shot of him smiling upped the ante x20 times jesus christ
-_DJEzZk2pc,Lame
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why so serious üòà
-_DJEzZk2pc,1:37 i just wanna say that pose  in the mirror brought some good memories of Heath's Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joker with a red nose? That ain't Joker, then."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Anyone else notice the sparks on his shoes while dancing on the steps? Perhaps one of his little trick gadgets to ignite fires ? Also notice the flowers in the hallways, another time honored classic trick weapon of his maybe ?? I‚Äôm Phyched"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin Phoenix is a God
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks so fucking good
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I think this looks interesting so far, can't wait üôÇ"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I cannot wait. I think Joaquin Phoenix is an amazing, bizarre, and unique talent that strives in weird roles like Gladiator, and now this, where I think he has the potential to be one of the best, if not the best joker to date. So hyped."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Also, fuck that other dude. Marks opinion of Joker is the only 1 that should matter. Fight me, Im willing to die on this hill."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Yes... my favorite male actor.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I hope this role does not damage Joaquin, because this can be so mentally taxing. With that being sad, this is such a cool take on the Joker. It's creepy, weird funny but dark at the same time. Amazing."
-_DJEzZk2pc,DC >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> MARVEL
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Okay...Im..Okay.

I never had doubts that he would be a great Joker. I was more effy on the actual script. Still am, but I love the general tone that this gives off.


Also, Not sure how I feel about him inspiring others. All the same clown mask attacking cops. Like Im sure that they are goons, but I also get the impression that they aspire to be Joker. Which fuck off. Even the other Villains fear him. Some of his followers do see him that way but ehh...to early. 

Honestly it is the way this is edited, it gives off that feeling."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Now this is a trailer! Joker, villain of villains."
-_DJEzZk2pc,such a great actor!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Joker is a broken person, he's been hurt and become a marvelous person, and thats why I love him no matter who played his role.."
-_DJEzZk2pc,we live in a society.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joker Begins
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Still Skeptical, but it looked pretty good."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"People who overrated the Gay Cowboy's performance will not like this.






I guarantee it."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"When i first heard that there was a Joker movie, I thought: it will probably be another flop. I saw the teaser and I actually hated it. I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to be any good... But then this trailer came out and....
I AM F**KING HYPED."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can already tell people want to shit on this movie
-_DJEzZk2pc,There will only ever be one Joker.  RIP Heath.
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks so shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,THANK YOU PHOENIX!!!!!!üëè
-_DJEzZk2pc,This actor in this role deserves a fucking saga!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Every one deserve to have a smile :) :) :) :) 
Very brave of U joaquim. 
I am shaking right now. Because i understand your message."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"This looks incredible, from the laughter to the voice, i can see him winning a Oscar for this."
-_DJEzZk2pc,So Jack Napier becomes the Joker through a head injury? Will this film include his stint as the Red Hood? Looks like they might be trying to turn Joker into some kind of hero. It looks like it could go either way still. I'm not sold on it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Earn won't like this
-_DJEzZk2pc,Song name?
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ahuenno
-_DJEzZk2pc,Okay. This looks amazing.
-_DJEzZk2pc,do batman will appear?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Brilliant what they‚Äôve done.

I hope mainstream audiences will get it, the story Joaquin wanted to tell with this character."
-_DJEzZk2pc,I didn't hate it...please God let this be a good movie...I need this for my soul.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Here before 10K views an I‚Äôm sure within 24 hours 1 million views
-_DJEzZk2pc,I can already tell this is going to be my favorite Joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Phoenix is bringing the BIG GUNS - as always. I hope the movie is as incredible as he appears to be here; we'll have a masterpiece (though I very much doubt it with the director of ""The Hangover""... But let's hope)."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Was that Matt Damon ???
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Trailer, nada demais!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,This movie is going to be a reborn from DC. I hope the trailer will be worse than the film itself. The hype is on.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Have too many stories about batman beginning, finally get one about joker"
-_DJEzZk2pc,"01:49 that boy is confirmed to be a young Bruce Wayne/Batman.
Dante Pereira-Olson is the child actor playing him."
-_DJEzZk2pc,meu deus!!!!maravilhoso!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Holy shit I thought that was Phil Dunphy
-_DJEzZk2pc,Meh.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I think we're on to something here, lads..."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I had my doubts, but this looks awesome."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"MCU - Final Endgame trailer
DC - üëèYAüëèDONEüëèTALKING?üëè"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin!!! So good!! Can't wait!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I always hoped Crispin Glover would play the Joker,great actor plus his laugh is already crazy sounding but Joaquin will do.Hope he gets ultra crazy in this!"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Wow:-)
-_DJEzZk2pc,This looks awesome. I didn't care much about this one but now it's a must watch.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nobody like heath ledger tho!
-_DJEzZk2pc,"If  you're going to do the Joker you better bring it, 


and they fucking brought it.."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Meh
-_DJEzZk2pc,This is not the Joker
-_DJEzZk2pc,My guess is this joker gonna die in this movie ...and new one will rise at the end with the same actor but against batman in the next movie...that would be awesome..
-_DJEzZk2pc,Jared Leto has left the chat.
-_DJEzZk2pc,I feel like I'm being really biased towards anybody who tries playing the joker now because i loved heath ledgers joker so much.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Am i the only one who thinks this lacks DC vibes? I mean, Joaquin as Joker = perfection. But the atmosphere, it brings the feeling of a psychological thriller."
-_DJEzZk2pc,oh man I‚Äôm so excited
-_DJEzZk2pc,just bring a god damn Oscar already.
-_DJEzZk2pc,OH MY GAWD!!!!! Incredible!
-_DJEzZk2pc,Joaquin doesn't get enough credit for his roles.
-_DJEzZk2pc,Why is this edited like a biographical movie about a real person?
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I wanna see a better trailer, how can they give us a trailer for a joker film so slow paced.."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Nothing will ever be able to beat Heath Ledger‚Äôs joker.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"No ""damaged"" tattoo? No strip club scene where a grilled-out Joker asks somebody if they want beef? I'll take it."
-_DJEzZk2pc,It looks like this will be for clowns what Falling Down was for frustrated white guys.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Now, I am super exited to watch it"
-_DJEzZk2pc,Stop making movie with the joker god rip heath ledger the best to ever do it. Bring the riddler back. Or scarecrow two face
-_DJEzZk2pc,the smile and look in the starting of the trailer reminds me of ted bundy

-_DJEzZk2pc,The spiral of insanity can finally be witnessed. Smile while doing it.
-_DJEzZk2pc,"I feel like I have already seen this movie, actually several times."
-_DJEzZk2pc,"No, no, no. This is clearly a self-indulgent attempt to be ‚Äòhigh-concept‚Äô, and not remotely faithful to the source material. To turn a beloved icon into some narcissistic director‚Äôs attempt to gain attention with a ‚Äòbrave‚Äô interpretation. Yet another comic movie not made by someone who understands comics. Am I the only one left who thinks a comic character should actually resemble the comic version? It looks utterly awful. I can‚Äôt help but think that people who like this have never actually bought a Batman comic."
-_DJEzZk2pc,Oh my god this is beautiful. I can picture Joaquin in a scene where he‚Äôs crying uncontrollably and begins to slowly turn into manically laughing
-_DJEzZk2pc,this beautiful

-_DJEzZk2pc,DOMINOOOOO
-_DJEzZk2pc,Ohhhhhh shit
-_DJEzZk2pc,"Another alternative reality origin story.  Wished they stuck a bit to the original story which is gritty and sad in itself.... but they did include his attempt to be a stand-up, so that's a plus.  Dressing him up as a clown as part of odd jobs is where it veers off the comics.  But if the basic premise is that a man is driven mad by society, desperation, the death of his wife and a fateful encounter with you-know-who...then I'm totally interested."

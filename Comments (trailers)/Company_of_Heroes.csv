pn_4KlFmkbU,"pro-american movie, sigh.... NEXT"
pn_4KlFmkbU,shaving ryans private.
pn_4KlFmkbU,"Read other history books, you poor little shit.
U think US or its allies can be the small part of the victory without Soviet Russia"
pn_4KlFmkbU,"Hey Rambo... Russia, Great Britain and the United States were Allies.... I suggest you study up on your history before you run your COCKTRAP! For future reference if you don't know about something keep your mouth shut if not for nothing at least you won't look like a complete and utter moron! "
pn_4KlFmkbU,If he meant battle then that's what he should have stated.... He said WAR!
pn_4KlFmkbU,He means this battle. The Battle of the Buldge was a desaster for the Americans. Portraying it this way insults the ones that died there. That is what he meant.
pn_4KlFmkbU,The funny thing is since the USSR invaded Poland as well they should have had war declared on them by France and the U.K. due to the treaty with Poland that caused the war.
pn_4KlFmkbU,Read your history moron Russia Great Britain and the United states were allies! Internet morons never cease to amaze!
pn_4KlFmkbU,"U spooked the truth..Also if Hitler wouldn't delayed his attack on USSR, and spread his army's on multiple fronts.he would have won the war very easy.  "
pn_4KlFmkbU,"Those guys look like pussies is you see the stats from russian millitary casualties 8,800,000
to 10,700,000"
pn_4KlFmkbU,"Yes... they were part of the ""Allies"" until the war ended."
pn_4KlFmkbU,so the soviets was an ally of the United States?
pn_4KlFmkbU,history books vary from country to country 
pn_4KlFmkbU,tom sizemore is a true war veteran!!!saving private ryan-black hawk down-pearl harbor-born on the fourth of july-company of heroes...
pn_4KlFmkbU,"Yes, it was not the soviets who cleared up 80% of the german army, right?The allies did their part alright but if it weren't for the russians they wouldn't have won the war on their own. It would have probably ended in a stalemate. If the germans defeated the soviets chances are that the axis would have won the war, given the resources of Russia.  "
pn_4KlFmkbU,"Actually it was the USSR industry , numbers and weather that defeated germany. During the invasion of Russia by Napoleon Bonaparte , the russian let napoleon invade up to a point and then bogged him down until winter hit. Napoleon , like Hitler's army was unequipped to deal with the winter in Russia and lost many troops to death from weather and disease. If hitler hadn't invaded the USSR , the D-Day landings would have been impossible. No D-day , no liberation of Europe , no defeat of the Nazis."

1000000000000 Germans"
pn_4KlFmkbU,"I think they are. In the Battle of the Bulge, the Wehrmacht used modified Panther to resemble the M10. This ruse didn't work really well, as the americans could easily recognise the chassis even with the added metal plates on itself and the turret.

pn_4KlFmkbU,"Vinny Jones is in it, say no more......."

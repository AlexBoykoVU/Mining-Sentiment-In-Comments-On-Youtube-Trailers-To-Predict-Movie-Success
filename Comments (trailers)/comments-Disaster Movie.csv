drOC1VNA8XM,"u writing a comment of youtube publicly makes it everybody's ""bess"" lmfao.

plus, i could ask you what kind of a comment is ""i guess ur stupid too it's the best"", just like how you asked me what kind of a name canucan is. its funny that you would concern yourself with that. totally irrelevant and doesnt really prove anything"
drOC1VNA8XM,none of ur bess canucan like what kind of name is that
drOC1VNA8XM,are u kidding me?
drOC1VNA8XM,When is it coming out DUDE !!
drOC1VNA8XM,"i gotta see that

drOC1VNA8XM,thats a stupid comment keytek
drOC1VNA8XM,"i guess ur stupid too

drOC1VNA8XM,Pretty much.
drOC1VNA8XM,Those guys made Scary movie i dont realy belive that cuz scary move is funny..well some parts of this movie too but the part with iron man and hanna montana its just pice of shit

drOC1VNA8XM,"That's true, I'm not going to see it because it looks stupid and I don't sit here saying ""oh my god this is gonna suck I hate people who see these movies because they're stupid ah ah ah I'm gonna go kill myself because hollywood isn't making the right movies ahh!"""

I think I'll sit outside my movie theatre with a ""Donate to the Poor"" box and give everybody the option of seeing Disaster Movie or donating $6-$10.85 to the poor. I'll make some starving African kids happy.

ADDITION to his comment add a TABLE AND The Trailer of the Disaster Movie beside the donation box and let people see the Bad and the Good"
drOC1VNA8XM,this movie for me looks funny but stupid at the same time
drOC1VNA8XM,Pineapple express???THAT MOVIE LOOKS FREAKIN HILARIOUS but competition with this garbage?By the looks of it it seems Pineapple Express already won this competition.The real competition I think will be Pineapple Express and Tropic Thunder those to movie look reall funny!!!
drOC1VNA8XM,oh god not another one. These movies fucking died a long time ago. The creators are just overkilling the whole series. Scary Movie 1 and 2 were and always will be the best ones.
drOC1VNA8XM,"Ah...no it doesn't. By the looks of it, it will definitely be a disaster. The title obviously hints you on that."
drOC1VNA8XM,the looks like a really funny movie!
drOC1VNA8XM,These guys deserve to have cows dropped on THEM.
drOC1VNA8XM,"Wow not these losers again!!! AUGH!!! They totally suck ass!!! I've seen date movie and epic movie and they epically fail!!! There is no way in hell I'll watch this. Unless someone tells me this is funny, which is more likely not, by the looks of it."
drOC1VNA8XM,"seems to have a budget of seven bucks. Did you see the iron man costume? And the sets? These guys are succesfull, they have enough money, and yet the production value is soooo low!"
drOC1VNA8XM,i love the last bit
drOC1VNA8XM,Wait... the fuck... disaster? THERE WASN'T A SINGLE DISASTER MOVIE PARODIED IN THAT ENTIRE GOD FORSAKEN PREVIEW!

dSBsNeYqh-k,"What takes me out of it is the fact this guy obsessed over a woman that is quite homely.  To me, not worth the stalking that takes place in the movie."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I'm pretty sure that there's a lot more to this movie than what has been shown so far, y'all retards need to shut the fuck up and just wait for the movie to come out"
dSBsNeYqh-k,When that guy shot himself in the leg though...
dSBsNeYqh-k,This film reminds me of Hollow man 2000
dSBsNeYqh-k,Two words: Thermal vision God Hollywood has turned to complete and utter shit.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Sure would be cold being naked all the time.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I went to watch this movie today thinking that it would be from the dark universe franchise. I really don't like horror movies, just the characters and the concept. (because I don't like getting scared). Should have watched the damn trailer."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Wow!  Scary!
dSBsNeYqh-k,1:27 that smile and eyebrow raise.  Very Jack Nicholson like way of playing crazy.   Like if they wanted to reboot Harley Quinn now as being a crazy lady who hangs out with the Joker they could use her.
dSBsNeYqh-k,When you try to sell something and your own clients tell you that you're selling it wrong
dSBsNeYqh-k,novody invented thermovosion in this universe? good job
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Learn this, kids: trailers two and a half minutes long... SPOILER the movie."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Who is the invisible man?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"The voice, every psyco can make a voice. They do while working. To be faint"
dSBsNeYqh-k,what if there invisible women
dSBsNeYqh-k,So original. See Hollow man 1 and 2. Hollywood is so out of ideas now it's pathetic.
dSBsNeYqh-k,the trailer just gave the entire movie up. fuck this
dSBsNeYqh-k,Am I tripping or did this trailer just give away everything???
dSBsNeYqh-k,Because of trailers like this i wont go see the movie. Shouldnt be so hard to make a cool trailer without spoiling the whole movie.      Remake or not.
dSBsNeYqh-k,June ‚ô•Ô∏è
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks worse than hollowman
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Looks great, but I'm so sick of every trailer ruining the movie. They showed all the action, the plot, his possible motives. Like, come on."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Now, I get it that why Nolan is great."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Reminds me of Hollow Man (2001)
dSBsNeYqh-k,supporting this movie is supporting scientology! look into the religion and make ur own judgment
dSBsNeYqh-k,I went for an audition for this Muck but the casting director could see me so he told me to get lost & stay there. üò¢üëéüò¢
dSBsNeYqh-k,Well they pretty much ratted out the whole movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,"*Facepalm.* This looks absolutely cheap and disappointing. VFX is complete garbage in comparison to original ""Hollow Man (2000)"". And that's with 20 years of difference?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,OK. I don't need to watch the movie anymore.
dSBsNeYqh-k,i think they mispelled John Cena
dSBsNeYqh-k,We all freaked out about how this trailer spoils everything. I just walked out of the screening....trust me everyone. The trailer shows a lot but there‚Äôs some unexpected twists in it that actually blew my mind.
dSBsNeYqh-k,I knew John Cena would Eventually get his own movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,This movie looks good Elisabeth Moss was good in US and The Kitchen
dSBsNeYqh-k,Anybody Ravi Babu Fans here right now ?!! ü§£ü§£ü§£
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Now playing : Show Yourself - Idina Menzel, Evan Rachel Wood (Frozen 2)"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Fun Fact: As a child, Elizabeth Moss voiced a child in Batman the Animated series episode ""See No Evil"" whose father was also stalking her as an Invisible Man. That is some Meta casting right there."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Before sees any comments in this trailer, i think the trailer truly talk too much, but much ppl agreed with that, we not really interest to watch on theatre because the trailer described too much."
dSBsNeYqh-k,1:44 dog senses something is there and starts barking.
dSBsNeYqh-k,1:44 did that dog just moan
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Saw the movie tonight at an early screening, it was good. Not amazing.  it was good from the  middle to end. Go at your own risk"
dSBsNeYqh-k,ok so thermal technologies just doesn't exist in this universe
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I remember the movie ""100 Feet""... kind of..üòÅ"
dSBsNeYqh-k,He probably killed himself to turn invisible
dSBsNeYqh-k,From the novel by H. G. Wells.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Movie is 2h long and its only 2 min of trailer how did you see whole movie ???
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Me: *checks comments while video is loading*
Me: oh"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Damn, can't believe they made an entire horror movie out of Eden Hazard's career."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Who's here after the surprising Rotten Tomatoes Score = 90% 

Jason Blum and Leigh Whannel the best....."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Dad?
dSBsNeYqh-k,This movie is about john cena
dSBsNeYqh-k,"For those of you that think the whole movie‚Äôs shown in this trailer, those that have seen it say it‚Äôs not"
dSBsNeYqh-k,This should be a action movir
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I thought Johnny Depp was supposed to be in this. Where is he? 





... Oh, I get it."
dSBsNeYqh-k,I think that... nobody will go and SEE... the invisible man... in the cinema.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I‚Äôm not gonna pay to watch a movie about a white man abusing his white woman then he becomes invincible to continue to torture her, to abuse her physically, emotionally,  psychologically & mentally. There‚Äôs nothing scary or horror about a story that is plain and simple of a Man Abusing a Woman on the large screen. Period. I said what I said, don‚Äôt delete my comment! üó£








It‚Äôs sad how we are getting a Domestic Violence Movie Review instead of a Thriller movie, ‚ÄúFantasy Island‚Äù it was market as a Horror film but it wasn‚Äôt, it was a Thriller. It was really good! Go watch that instead! ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"the first one was the best ""Hollow Man"" 2000"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Okay I get it we are mad how the trailer showed everything  right, but why did we continue to watching it until the end?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Plot twist: she's on drugs
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Ok... I can fill in the gaps, thanks for showing everything and letting me save my money."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Plot twist:adrian is using a invisibility cloak from harry potter
dSBsNeYqh-k,Skinny legend Mariah Carey will be cast as the Invisible Man
dSBsNeYqh-k,So what if invisible man needs to take a shit?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Is he a ghost? Is he invisible? Is she crazy? 
*Reads title.
I WONDER WHICH IT COULD BE?!?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Slender man: wanna partners?? Invisible man
dSBsNeYqh-k,This trailer cracks me up.. I wouldn't stalk that woman if she were the last on earth
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Great! Now~ thanks to the marketing genius who just HAD to show 75% of the best action sequences of the entire movie, I have to somehow keep my wife from seeing this trailer, so we can actually see this movie on Saturday, which is our scheduled ‚ÄúDate Night‚Äù. 

Of course, I‚Äôm excited for SUSHI! But we‚Äôll see what happens guys!

The movie looks great, hopefully it has a few cliffhanger moments that we haven‚Äôt seen! Lol"
dSBsNeYqh-k,oof i need to watch dis
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Going after an invisible man with a knife. People always underestimate the sledgehammer as a weapon. Heavy as hell, legal in any state, easy to get, long reach. Could shatter his knees with a good swing"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Just got out of an advanced screening. It's really good guys. At first I was concerned with how much the trailer reveals. It's not as much as you think. The film moves pretty fast.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Ill let all u waste your money going to a movie theater buying the tickets mabe some pop corn and some candy while i wouch it on my phone for free

dSBsNeYqh-k,If this movie doesn‚Äôt have scatman john in the soundtrack am gonna be fairly dissapointed
dSBsNeYqh-k,I saw screening of it and it's really terrifying.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Debating if I want to watch this trailer bc I love thrillers and I really want to see this in the theater.
dSBsNeYqh-k,lol I was hyped for this movie now I'm not even sure if its worth watching
dSBsNeYqh-k,Universal...just admit y'all don't know what you're all doing when it comes to classic monster movies.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Anyone know the runtime of this movie?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Rebooted. The original has a great quote: I¬†meddled in things that man must leave alone
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Wow, really? Almost every fucking person saying ""it's a whole movie"", shut up already, no need for EVERYONE to say the same thing over and over and over again. I'm actually exited to see this, even though I'm not a horror kind of person, but this doesn't really look like a horror, more like ""on the edge of the seat"" thriller and I can't wait üòä"
dSBsNeYqh-k,5 minutes into it that's all it took and now some more names added to the list the üí© list. The Invisible Man (2020) employees!!!! ask about what happened to one fellow member of the movie industry. Louisville Slugger the sound of swatting a bitch ass actor across the mouth is so fucking beautiful.
dSBsNeYqh-k,There isn't a single person whining here about the trailer showing the whole movie who would have paid to see it anyway.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Like the hollow man
dSBsNeYqh-k,"How can I undo my memory for this trailer? Even though it may seem obvious I didn‚Äôt think it was a suit I thought it was some kind of supernatural stuff but I feel like I know everythinggggggg, even with the ‚Äúfound you‚Äù and the knife at the end ugh. Would have ended it with the breathing or something"
dSBsNeYqh-k,The trailer should have stopped at 0:55

dSBsNeYqh-k,Her husband is God-invisible..is anywhere and everywhere!!!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Is God Invisible?? You can't see God, but he's there!!!  What about the movie God Ain't Dead!  Somebody metaphoricaly dead---they are dead but still very much alive."

dSBsNeYqh-k,The thing I would do is get a knife üî™ and just spin around sitting so I can cut him just like beyblades
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Years ago I read a book about a man who worked for the US government and he was given a serum that turned him invisible so he could assassinate someone important. However, he didn't do it because he found out that they were going to dispose of him upon completion and instead went on the run, invisible, and was hunted down etc. Does anybody know what the book was called because I cannot remember at all and cannot find it anywhere. I read it around 2000 so it's at least 20 years old now and I want to read it again. It's on a long list of books I read growing up that I want to reread. Thank you in advance.ü•∞"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Well, well, well, if it ain't the invisible cunt."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Dammit Kevin bacon is at it again.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Thanks, Universal. That trailer has just saved us all the trouble of a trip to the cinema. 
Don't be surprised if it bombs."
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is part of the Dark Universe???
dSBsNeYqh-k,"While they did show a little too much in the trailer, I can assure you all there's still plenty in the film that wasn't spoiled and it's definitely worth checking out."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hopefully this is nothing similar to The Hollow Man
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Come on, it doesnt matter that the trailer was a bit long, I cant wait to see this movie......"
dSBsNeYqh-k,I read the H.G. Wells book this week after hearing this film was inspired by it. I was excited to watch a movie like the book.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Yeah, people saying they spoiled the whole movie obviously haven't read the original novel.

Of cause he's real. He's the title character and yes she fights back. They spoiled nothing major. No doubt there's going to be a few twists in this. It's only loosely based on the book."
dSBsNeYqh-k,2:17 show yourself~~ ahahahah~~
dSBsNeYqh-k,Blumhouse has to start looking for  a new trailer company. They are spoiling all of their movies.
dSBsNeYqh-k,When Universal goes on a budget:
dSBsNeYqh-k,"i‚Äôm keep it real, G? this looks like the worst movie ever made."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Anyone age 45-50 has seen this movie before.
It was cancelled the entity.
LOL"
dSBsNeYqh-k,The guy who played the ain charac3was good looking don't u think?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Was waiting for the invisible man to start playing in the background tbh
dSBsNeYqh-k,So is this the dark universe?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Uploading full movie in YouTube is illegal you know
dSBsNeYqh-k,"The sad thing is that 80% of the trailers are like this, lately... and I don't know why. 
Probably it sells better cause the average person wants to go to the theatre knowing what he is watching?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,It's Kevin Bacon!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"WHY SHOW MOST OF MOVIES HIGHILIGHTS.

dSBsNeYqh-k,H.G. Wells has to be throwing up in his tomb. I really hope the director of this shit and his actress die in a very cruel way
dSBsNeYqh-k,The world is filled with Psychopaths just waiting for their formula to work
dSBsNeYqh-k,Early rumors is this is the first big hit of 2020.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Wow

dSBsNeYqh-k,"Thought this was going to be a remake, they should have called it "" Screen Trash"" ."
dSBsNeYqh-k,I read the book saw the original movie love them but what in the hell is this crap? They should have remade the story from the book. pure garbage don't even waste your time read the book see the original movie!!!

dSBsNeYqh-k,"Trailer way too long, I just seen the whole movie pretty much."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Why are invisible-man movies always so brutally violent? Invisibility could lead to madness, sure, like in Wells' book. It could also be used by cruel, violent people. But why ALWAYS such grisly, suffering, bloody violence? Then when they try to make Invisible Girl in Fantastic Four movies, they suck so bad, they make the audience wanna get violent. Shaking My Dang Head."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Yall really fucked up
dSBsNeYqh-k,People in jailbreak who do the invisible glitch.

You beautiful people!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Congratulations for naming your movie after a Queen song
dSBsNeYqh-k,Yo John cena's role is spot on
dSBsNeYqh-k,Watch the 1993 version instead.  Its much nicer and has a happy ending.

dSBsNeYqh-k,00:14+00:15+00:16+00:17
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This looked like a good movie, but I'm not going to watch it now since I feel like I watched the whole thing in the trailer. 
Why are there so many idiots making trailers these days and giving the whole movie away?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Wen da fuxck dis shii gon drop..
dSBsNeYqh-k,Loose remake of Hollow Man?ü§î
dSBsNeYqh-k,Another film about a bad man and a strong woman- BORING..
dSBsNeYqh-k,Kevin Bacon did it better
dSBsNeYqh-k,Damn for one he has a nice ass house plenty of unlimited food wifi tv comfy bed an he look sexy to not gonna lie seem like id be more crazy than him üòÇüòÇüòÇ
dSBsNeYqh-k,H.G wells would've been disappointed
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I don‚Äôt see the invisible guy 
Trailer 1/10"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"1:56 

Johnny Gill in....
Don't Come Any Closer (2018)"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Well thats the whole movie pretty much and it could have been 10x scarier. I thought it would be more of a paranormal activity type movie but its more of an abusive husband type shit
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I was gonna watch this but then they showed the entire movie in the trailer, so no need to. Whoever made this trailer needs to get fired lol"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"So, an updated version of Hollow Man"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this considered as ''horror movie'' these days? Hahaha what a fucking joke seriously.üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ  RIP horror movies
dSBsNeYqh-k,Wasnt this supposed to be a johnny depp movie..?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Fred ? Fred Waterford, is that you ?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,John Cena is the invisible man.
dSBsNeYqh-k,How great would that be!
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks like a great movie which was spoiled by the trailer :/
dSBsNeYqh-k,Thanks for showing the whole movie in the trailer so now I don‚Äôt have to pay for it.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks fucking terrible and the lead actress is a batshit scientologist. No thanks
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I don't understand this new trend of showing the entire movie in the trailers. This one seems interesting, but now why would I want to go see it? I already know the plot, the twist and even part of the ending. Universal should fire the dipwits who edit these trailers."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Welp, I will never be able to sleep again. Thanks."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Looks good, can‚Äôt wait to see what it‚Äôs about."
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks good
dSBsNeYqh-k,Damn this new movie with john cena is awesome
dSBsNeYqh-k,Why are they doing this?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This is lame. Yet another movie where some guy is hurting some woman and she has to be strong and overcome. What BS. In the original, the guy loved his fiancee and was trying to be someone great... for her. I mean, let me get this straight: you've got the key to invisibility and of all the myriad possibilities that exist with that, your best idea is to torment your ex?? Hell, you could kill her and literally get away with murder. Who could find you? Man, this influx of ""reimaginings"" with a pc tilt have just caused entertainment to hit an all time low. Maybe it's time to turn off the tube, stop going to the theater and do something with that extra time. Like write a real movie. ‚úç"
dSBsNeYqh-k,So hollow man Remake? Also all she need was some type of heat sensor/thermal vision lmao so stupid
dSBsNeYqh-k,STOP. SHOWING. TOO. MUCH. IN. TRAILERS.
dSBsNeYqh-k,So this is a remake of 1933 version of the Invisible Man.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"1933: Black velvet background special effect.
2020: Green screen CGI special effect."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"""Look, he's all eaten away.""-Constable from 1933 Invisible Man"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Draw? Is that you buddy?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Great movie, a bit short though."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I don't wanna sound like an ass hole, but I feel like I would care more about this movie if she was attractive lmfao"
dSBsNeYqh-k,I didn‚Äôt know Invisible Woman had a brother that kills people for no reason
dSBsNeYqh-k,This movie will bomb at the box office lol it basically looks dumb.
dSBsNeYqh-k,The new Kuroko No Basuke trailer looks good.
dSBsNeYqh-k,These trailer nowadays are helping me save money.
dSBsNeYqh-k,my anxiety
dSBsNeYqh-k,"2:20 Why is she smiling, like she's excited, at the thought of murdering her ex?

From what I understand:

-she was in an abusive relationship
-she got out
-she's living a normal life, as a stable, rational, adult.

Why does she go, from typical person, to psychopath? That's either bad directing, or the director thinks that's normal human behavior.

If you are forced, to kill someone, why would you be happy? ü§®
You're being forced, to do something."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Forgot the invisible man was A Universal Monster.

OK so the Dark Universe isn't canceled or did it just take forever, for this movie, to release?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is what happens when RL Stine forgets about him
dSBsNeYqh-k,That looks awesome
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks good
dSBsNeYqh-k,Thank christ this movie is going to be R rated instead of pg-13 as all horror movies should be R rated in the first place
dSBsNeYqh-k,Bro that‚Äôs the whole movie right there
dSBsNeYqh-k,NOBODY CAUGHT HG WELL‚ÄôS CLASSIC INVISIBLE MAN CAMEO/EASTER EGG!!!????!!
dSBsNeYqh-k,I have really high hopes for this movie I hope it‚Äôs goodü§û
dSBsNeYqh-k,"do you  know  the writer and director  is  leigh whannell ( writer of "" saw""  ), i forget he made  the trailer  xd"
dSBsNeYqh-k,This was a good movie.  Like watching it in forward fast
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Dude just tossed a 130lb woman across a room. I‚Äôd say steroid problem first, invisibility problem second."
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks like a trailer for a bad movie from the 80's
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Okay, I‚Äôm a complete crybaby when it comes to any type of horror/thriller film, but I REALLY wanna watch thisüòØ"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"""Well well well, if it ain't the invisible cunt"""
dSBsNeYqh-k,Im invisible.they say no we can see you#shadowangelz#shadowtribe....shadow
dSBsNeYqh-k,Eh don't care. I hated the original always thought the idea was boring until Kevin Bacon did it and only the science stuff on the subject was fascinating to me in that movie. Love Elizabeth Moss though hopefully this will be successful for her and all involved
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Crazy men whom one can see of scary enough...lawd, imagine a crazy one no one can see."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Here we go with Universal with their Dark Universe again.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I love it, I‚Äôll definitely watch the SEQUEL when is it???"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Wow I can't believe they mad an entire movie about John cena
dSBsNeYqh-k,Wont go to watch it because I have just seen it here. ty producers. gg wp
dSBsNeYqh-k,it's just her stand ability
dSBsNeYqh-k,"woah that scared the shit outta me. my name is Cecilia, i rarely find people with the same name as me."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"‚ÄúI‚Äôm the invisable man.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm the invisable man.‚Äù
‚ÄúIncredible how you can see right through me.‚Äù"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"stupid trailer, i dont think i will watch the movie now that i know eveything about it."
dSBsNeYqh-k,No need to see this one boys! Whole damn thing is in the trailer.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Who says that Invisibility is a stupid super power?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Thanks for the movie, now I don't have to spend $5."
dSBsNeYqh-k,He's wearing some kind of suit that makes him invisible. Ironically Elizabeth Moss voiced a little girl in Batman: The Animated Series whose father had the same thing. I wonder if it's a coincidence or they cast her because of that.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this Hollow Man 2.0?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Okay, okay so Superman was flying right extrememly horny and everything okay.
Anyway as he flies he sees Wonder Woman sunbathing naked on the roof of the justice league looking like she's having the time of her life so Supes thinks ""God this is hot. I'll just jerk off really quick."" A few seconds later he then thinks ""Wait I'm Superman I could go in get me some Wonder Pussy and be out in less then a second."" He then swoops down does his thing really fast then flies away. Wonder Woman quickly sits up and says ""What the fuck was that?""
Then the Invisible Man goes ""I don't know but my ass hurts like hell!"""
dSBsNeYqh-k,It sucks because some of this looks great but some of the writing and acting looks bad...like does he have super human strength? Cause people are flying across rooms. If so it‚Äôs military tech and makes me not believe the stalker husband motive. That‚Äôs a lot of effort just to fuck with her...
dSBsNeYqh-k,Damnit you ruined the movie for me ufh
dSBsNeYqh-k,So this is starring John Cena from wwe?
dSBsNeYqh-k,QUIT SPAMMING ADS LIKE THIS UR GIVIN ME PARANOIA
dSBsNeYqh-k,Well damn they showed us the whole movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This movie looks real bad. I mean I can appreciate the whole ""invisible domestic violence"" metaphor, but not when it's so on the nose it gets old during the course of the trailer."
dSBsNeYqh-k,üí™üèæ
dSBsNeYqh-k,Why was he breathing so damn hard ?
dSBsNeYqh-k,ths movie msllely
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Man, John Cena would be a good pick for this role"
dSBsNeYqh-k,so that‚Äôs where Hagakure gets it from
dSBsNeYqh-k,Damn i guess I know everything that happens in the movie so need need to buy a ticket to see it
dSBsNeYqh-k,The more bags she has under her eyes the sexier I think she looks
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is just a spin-off from the boys about the ‚Äòinvisible c*nt‚Äô
dSBsNeYqh-k,Sooooooooo hollow man reboot.
dSBsNeYqh-k,It was John Cena
dSBsNeYqh-k,Wasn't there a movie like this a couple years ago?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Remake of hollow manü§£ü§£
dSBsNeYqh-k,"So,




Is this gonna be in the mcu
""Just Curious'"
dSBsNeYqh-k,So basically drax
dSBsNeYqh-k,Yeah let‚Äôs just reveal the twist and while we‚Äôre at it show the entire movie within the first trailer.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Why not jus name it hollow man3
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is that what my dad did?
dSBsNeYqh-k,5 second later I quit
dSBsNeYqh-k,It didn‚Äôt just show the entire movie in the trailer it showed the literal climax where she kills him and the oneliner
dSBsNeYqh-k,So is this what  happens after  she makes it to Canada  with her little girl from the series hand maid. Looks like the same husband  and everything!?!?!
dSBsNeYqh-k,Can someone confirm this is the movie with Johnny Depp as the invisible man?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Even though they basically showed the entire movie I still can‚Äôt wait to see it
dSBsNeYqh-k,"You get one last chance, Universal. You hear me? One. Last. Chance."
dSBsNeYqh-k,So not in dark universe?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Just because they showed her dumping paint on the invisible man doesn‚Äôt give away the whole film you all need to watch it before you judge
dSBsNeYqh-k,Trailer should have stopped around 50 seconds. Maybe even at 40. After that you're getting the whole movie.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"HOLLYWOOD,, doesnt get it ,WERE DONE WITH WOKEEEEEEEE MOVIES!!!!!!,"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Thanks for the plot and the ending don‚Äôt need to spend 30 bucks at the movies.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"despite the fact that i just saw the entire movie on trailer, i still want to see it"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Movie tickets pass. I'll just keep rewatching it over n over in 3 mins
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Anyone saying that it's only 2 1/2 minutes of a 90 minute movie. ""You don't know how the movie will turn out."" 
Pay attention simpleton. It's all in the trailer. It proposes a mystery of whether she's crazy or not(had me completely intrigued), shows us what seems like every intense/creepy scene and then reveals that she's not crazy and dude is genuinely invisible(mystery solved). The only question now is whether or not the invisible man dies and that's not worth paying for.

After seeing the end of the trailer I had 10% doubt that he was real and that maybe this is just some kind of psychological episode that she's visualizing but after hearing so many people say that this is based off of a previous movie/book, I know I'm right and it's just a old case of stocker boyfriend. 1‚≠êÔ∏è"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"""The invisible klansman"" truth is he is really pissed she left him for a negro... racist"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow man must be pissed off
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Aww.  No.  Damn it, I was really hoping this would be about an invisible protagonist, in the spirit of H.F. Saint's novel.

But alas, it's a nutcase horror story."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"The Invisible Man fucked my ass, turns out it was my Uncle in his makeshift Halloween costume."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Plot twist: she's crazy.
C'mon people grow some imaginary."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I‚Äôm at a loss. I can‚Äôt believe they actually showed the entire movie, right down to the method she uses to see him, and how she kills him."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"There is absolutely zero inbetween.
This movie will either be amazing or complete shit"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Someone must of really pissed off Kevin Bacon for him to go  completely Invisible & fuck with the living!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Trailer guys, thanks to you, I just saw the whole film and can now save my $$."
dSBsNeYqh-k,I recognize her as Offred from The Handmaids TaleüòÇ
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks nothing like the book lmao
dSBsNeYqh-k,"They gave away the ending wthüòÇwhy did they show the end where she found out hes actually ""invisible"" and not dead"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks awesome
dSBsNeYqh-k,And His Name Is John Cena!!!!
dSBsNeYqh-k,Thanks for sharing the movie! Now... where‚Äôs the trailer?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Thanks for the whole movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,Stupid
dSBsNeYqh-k,Im glad i didnt press play judging from everyone‚Äôs comments ‚ò∫Ô∏è
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks like a decent movie.  Get ya popcorn ready.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Nice try, Universal. Should've gone with the bandage route."
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is a remake of the hollow man and i enjoyed it
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Isn't there a sequel ""The Return of the Invisible Man""?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Who would watch that trash
dSBsNeYqh-k,"So, why go see the movie if they just gave us the whole plot?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Would have preferred to see this stick much closer to Well‚Äôs original.. than some typical modern day ‚Äúhorror‚Äù.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Trash.
dSBsNeYqh-k,I like how they trying a different take on the ghost thing instead of it being a demon or something there using futuristic technology(I think)it‚Äôs nice to have something a little different
dSBsNeYqh-k,The Hollow Man has returned
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Well, well, well, if it ain't the invisible cunt."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Who writes this junk?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Just put powder on the floor
dSBsNeYqh-k,couldnt have even used queen ;(
dSBsNeYqh-k,"He is visible, its just that the people who can't see him isn't a stand user."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Bad movies always get trailers that dont show too much but good movies put so much in the trailer that you dont even have to go to the theater to watch it
dSBsNeYqh-k,This actually looks pretty good
dSBsNeYqh-k,If Dave Bautista or John Cena played as the Invisible Man. That memes or jokes for this will be absolutely hilarious.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"‚ÄúAn invisible man sleepin ' in your bed Ow, who you gonna call? Ghostbusters!‚Äù"
dSBsNeYqh-k,I CAME UP WITH THIS MOVIE 15 YEARS AGO I WANT CREDIT
dSBsNeYqh-k,elizabeth moss finally got a movie and we saw it already!
dSBsNeYqh-k,If all new movie trailers stop showing the whole movie in one trailer than they would make more money. It would leave people in suspense and the movie will make more money.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Nice. I hope in the end he dies in a burning elevator after being pushed asking for one last kiss.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Damn I literally don't feel like I have to watch the movie now. Whoever made this trailer is an idiot
dSBsNeYqh-k,"2:06 - it'd be cool to see some invisible guy somehow take on a dozen SWAT members, though I think VHS Viral already had this in a segment"
dSBsNeYqh-k,hopefully there's a bit of action in this
dSBsNeYqh-k,"thanks to the comments I didn't watch the full trailer, thank you! :)"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Y'know, this film could've saved the Dark Universe, you just had to NOT REVEAL THE ENTIRE PLOT"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Wow. Usually I roll my eyes when someone complains about the whole movie being in the trailer, but in this case, literally the entire plot is in this movie."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Wow! A white male attacking a poor white female! I wonder if it has to do with all of the bullshit politics of today? Why don't they make a horror movie about females lying and ending guys careers and sometimes lives? Oh yeah... It's doesn't fit the ""correct"" woke narrative of what's popular now. PASS. Oh yeah... And stop remaking fucking movies."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this a movie about Vietnam???
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I repeat if you are in the comments section, SKIP THE TRAILER, it spoils the whole movie"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Plot twist, it‚Äôs John Cena"
dSBsNeYqh-k,I legit thought this was a fucking joke when i saw the clip of him on the chair
dSBsNeYqh-k,"That‚Äôs strange,my dad can do that to."
dSBsNeYqh-k,should have ended the trailer at 1:16
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks so retarded
dSBsNeYqh-k,It‚Äôs obviously John Cena
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Remember when The Invisible Man was a comedy? Made by the same studio, too."
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is a total copy of hollow man the movie was about an invisible man
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This trailer is terrible, but I will still go see this. Looks pretty good. Plus, Elisabeth moss is fantastic"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Garbage.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This has been done before...anyone remember the movie ""Hollow Man""? It came out in 2000"
dSBsNeYqh-k,why dont any of them spy check
dSBsNeYqh-k,Spy cheek!
dSBsNeYqh-k,What if Kevin Bacon was in this
dSBsNeYqh-k,I see holes in your edit game
dSBsNeYqh-k,Why do I feel like this movie is a representation of the eternal feminazi victim mentality?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Hmmmm okay let me get this straight:
1. A psychologically unstable man who becomes invisible
2. A woman who get stalked by the obsessed #1
3. He gets killed in the end.

I guess i must be watching Hollow Man."
dSBsNeYqh-k,The day before February 28 is my birthday
dSBsNeYqh-k,"1:18 Hmm... movie called Invisible Man, there's a bass chillin behind the chair. Maybe I'm wrong, but it could be a reference to the Queen wong ""The Invisible Man"", which is known for having a great bassline."
dSBsNeYqh-k,I felt like this would have been a great trailer that would have gotten people excited for a good movie if it just left out the final 30 seconds that kinda spoils what happens.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Horror Franchise Rankings ""Invisible Man""
Haven't seen Invisible Man (2020 Remake)

1. Invisble Man (1933)
2. Invisible Man Returns (1940)
3. Invisible Agent (1944)
4. Invisible Woman (1935)"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Movies have lost their touch especially horror
dSBsNeYqh-k,So A knock off hollow man?!üòÇ
dSBsNeYqh-k,the entire fucking movie got shown
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Only saw the first half of the trailer, but so far it looks like the story is gonna be way too over complicated"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Kevin Bacon already did it.
dSBsNeYqh-k,This woman really is just a stand user
dSBsNeYqh-k,Good thing a bag of flour is cheap. Problem solved.
dSBsNeYqh-k,I guess Johnny Deep wasn't going to be in the new invisible man after all
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I havent watched the trailer. Everybody says the trailer spoils everything. So is it worth actually watching the movie, without watching the trailer?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"He ate the suke suke nomi, just swim in water smh"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Maybe it‚Äôs a good thing that we got the whole movie in the trailer because I‚Äôm willing to bet this is one of those movies where one or two simple actions could solve the problem and the lead is forced to be too stupid to think of them.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Well, this movie should vanish from theaters after a couple of days."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"apparently, between this and Handmaid's Tale, every dude that comes within 100 feet of this dog is obsessed with her...it's preposterous."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Well dont need to see this movie now, trailer gives everything away. Thanks for saving me the money lol."
dSBsNeYqh-k,*Drops utensil* ‚Äúhe was a sociopath‚Äù lmao idk
dSBsNeYqh-k,Imagine complaining that the trailver for the invisible man has an invisible man in it
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Is this a split personalities, distorted outlook on reality mixed with paranoid psychosis type of thing?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Anyone else feeling like the big house was inspired by Sleeping with the Enemy from 1991? :)
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Really neat concept, trailer does show a lot of the movie, but I'm hopeful that there'll be a interesting or satisfying twist of some sort - whatever it could be"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"why did they change the invisible man from ""Scientist who had an accident but became mad with power!"" to ""angry ex boyfriend"""
dSBsNeYqh-k,Oha o neydi be muhte≈üem
dSBsNeYqh-k,They hire John Cena ?!
dSBsNeYqh-k,Suddenly I thought this was a remake of Hollow Man
dSBsNeYqh-k,Just saw the entire film above so will be passing on this one.
dSBsNeYqh-k,So no Johnny Depp?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Thats a bad trailer
dSBsNeYqh-k,So is this connected to the dark universe??
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks good.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is being invisible even a real threat? You can just wear thermal goggles.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"let me guess- a 36
yr old white guy who‚Äôs 5‚Äô8‚Äô, earns 50k a year and has male pattern baldness. Pretty f#%kin invisible. Am I right? Ehhh ahhhh I get no respect"
dSBsNeYqh-k,This trailer showed too much. From beginning to end of the movie. The end credits might as well have rolled at the end.
dSBsNeYqh-k,No kevin bacon?...
dSBsNeYqh-k,So guy makes himself invisible for his lifes work just to abuse his ex ?  Really ? That is the best fucking horror concept they came up with like that was the shit they went with off theq drawing board ? Why tf does it have to be a horror slasher anyway lmfao
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Guy learns to bend light, just to harass meh ex-girlfriend. üòí"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Girl: someone is sitting in that chair

Me: *pours water on them and powder* there he is"
dSBsNeYqh-k,this a good movie can not wait it come out on the 28
dSBsNeYqh-k,Watered down hollow man
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Fricking 12 gauge shotgun and some paint, spray that paint over that motherfcker with a paint gun and shred his face with the 12 gauge"
dSBsNeYqh-k,This would have been an awesome physiological movie us not really knowing if he went invisible or it was all in her head and only finding out the true in the end but they just spoiled the whole movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Um, this is just it follows 2.0"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Sorry but this doesn't catch my eye at all...
dSBsNeYqh-k,Good thing they showed the whole movie! Now I dont have to pay to see it!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"nah, he's just hacking"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"how much of the movie should we put in the trailer?
whoever tf made this: *yes*"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Thanks for showing the entire movie now I don't have to bother paying to watch it :^)
dSBsNeYqh-k,Meet the spy
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Should have ended the trailers after they showed the shot her saying "" theres someone sitting in that chair """
dSBsNeYqh-k,Sweet. I feel satisfied with just the trailer. I feel like I saw everything I needed to see lol.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I'm impressed that they didn't CGI this time...




Instead they casted John Cena for the movie, *bold choice.*"
dSBsNeYqh-k,3rd times the charm?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"The funny thing is, if you are invisible, you are blind. Invisibility makes light pass through you, which means your eyes can't absorb it in order to see. So you're basically safe from him"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Finally Drax Get a own movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,The John cena documentary
dSBsNeYqh-k,I bet Harry Potter can't find his invisibility cloak right now
dSBsNeYqh-k,"The trailer show the fucking entire movie, what the fucking point, another movie I wont watch because of the stupid trailer."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Crazy, I didn't know they casted my ex in this... I should've seen right through her too. Excellent casting y'all!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is basically the entire movie but without the boring scenes
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I like long trailer so much, no need to go see the movie now... -_-"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Well now it‚Äôs just a waste to spend my money on a movie that it‚Äôs trailer reveals the entire plot.
dSBsNeYqh-k,There is no need for me to go see this in theaters Because I just seen it through the trailer
dSBsNeYqh-k,Are they not doing the Dark Universe anymore cause I thought Johnny Depp was gonna be cast as the invisible man oh well lol
dSBsNeYqh-k,Couldn‚Äôt they use heat signatures to find him :ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
dSBsNeYqh-k,Probably gonna flop and be a cult classic
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I'm not even going to waste my freaking time on watching a stupid ass movie based on nothing what a real fucking life human being would do.

Humans in fucking REAL REAL life:
Oh, someone sitting in the chair? Let me SIT ON TOP OF HIM! OH, NOTHING HAPPENED. That's real life for you. I hate stupid unrealistic movies like this garbage."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Lousy trailer, but it‚Äôs directed by Leigh Whannell, so it‚Äôs probably going to at least be somewhat decent"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Dumb
dSBsNeYqh-k,*Bruh this is one of stupidest concept of a movie that I can‚Äôt wait to watch I like how trailer basically kinda spoils everything but it gets me intrigued to want to watch it even more*
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Could care less if the whole movie was just spoiled to me, I wanna see this movie. I‚Äôve been seeing ads left and right and I never laughed so hard in a while"
dSBsNeYqh-k,I‚Äôm so weak with these comments. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
dSBsNeYqh-k,Just through flour on the guy and everyone would be able to see him.
dSBsNeYqh-k,I'm getting Popcorn started....and replaying this shit...it shows the whole movie hahha
dSBsNeYqh-k,Smh another movie starring john cena
dSBsNeYqh-k,Say/do  something. üò•
dSBsNeYqh-k,Translucent?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"All of you complaining about having seen the whole movie in the trailer, will be the first ones to line up to go watch it."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Did they just show us the whole film in a trailer lol still looks good tho
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This looks good a lot of people are  complaining about the trailer over showing the movie, however I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing this!!!ü§òüèæüí´üôÇ"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Drax deserves better
dSBsNeYqh-k,Drax gets his own movie.
dSBsNeYqh-k,The trailer should have ended after we see his breath breathing behind her shoulder.  End it with a tease.  Don't give away the whole movie.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Love it üòçüòòüòç
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This reminds me of that episode in The Big Bang Theory, where the guys are talking about monster movie trends, like zombies and werewolves; Raj randomly says ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt had a good invisible man in a while.‚Äù"
dSBsNeYqh-k,I've seen this movie thanks to the trailer and I didn't like it.
dSBsNeYqh-k,I just watched the whole fuckin' movie. Why are trailers like this?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Its John Cena because You Can't See Him.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Im actually excited for this
dSBsNeYqh-k,we all know it's john cena
dSBsNeYqh-k,I'm glad this trailer didn't spoil the entire movie.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Marvel finally gave Drax his own spinoff movie!
dSBsNeYqh-k,From the director of Upgrade?!? I‚Äôm sold.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"They showed so much ‚Äúproving‚Äù that he‚Äôs invisible that I‚Äôm kinda convinced she is crazy, and this was just to throw us off the scent."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Saw a small ad that intrigued me but damn am i glad i paused and looked at the comments first. Cant trust a trailer to not give away too much plot anymore
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I'm still going to go see it. We may know the plot, but build up and suspense is worth the wait."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This looks like it could have been good and genuinely terrifying, but I‚Äôve pretty much watched the whole movie just from this trailer."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks really good.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Plot twist:She‚Äôs a stand user
dSBsNeYqh-k,"They gave the queen song a movie adaptation. Whats next, the band making a cameo on tv or on the radio?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is so unrealistic. I mean anyone can see that Elizabeth Moss is in no way hot enough for someone to transcend death in order to stalk her. This would NEVER happen.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"ü§ó was a good movie! Don't need to go to the cinema.
I noticed he won't die cause at the end he is at the hospital üòâ check this movie again to see what I mean...ooops sorry this trailer ü§£"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"You know. A lot of people seem to be upset about this trailer ""showing the whole plot"" and I understand the complaints, but at the same time there's often so much more to a movie than just what the trailer shows."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollywood can‚Äôt be original anymore. It‚Äôs like they remastered Hollowman
dSBsNeYqh-k,Swing on him!
dSBsNeYqh-k,Disturbing but amazing movie from the looks of it. Can't wait!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"The guy‚Äôs discovered how to make people invisible which means he‚Äôs at least as smart as Hawking, Einstein and Newton and he‚Äôs using this fantastic technology to stalk his ex? Move on man!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Great another Hollywood trailer that gives the entire movie....thanks for saving me the money from going to the theater
dSBsNeYqh-k,1:39 why did they just spoil a part of the movie?
dSBsNeYqh-k,That was a great movie.
dSBsNeYqh-k,That's prophet in nanosuit bruh
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Warning to anyone watching this trailer, don't...."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Incredible how he can
dSBsNeYqh-k,I thought It's remake of Invisible man (1933)
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I found the idea of a man becoming invisible more plausible than 
a man stalking and losing his shit over Ms Piggy here."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Of all the women he can stalk in the world, he picks her? ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This is perfect, a trailer that shows us the entire movie so now all subtlety, mystery, intrigue, and anything that would have made this movie interesting is now pretty much down the toilet"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Why are the kind of people that spoils movies getting jobs at making trailers?
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is that daydream you had in class
dSBsNeYqh-k,Well... no need to see it now....
dSBsNeYqh-k,Why not ask them for paint or a similar substitute it‚Äôs not a big deal so I image they would oblige and the only thing you could really do is drown yourself but if there there with you that wouldn‚Äôt happen sooo. If they see some silhouette paint man they gonna fucking believe you
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I can‚Äôt believe that the spy from Tf2 is getting a horror movie about him, let‚Äôs hope and pray that this girl doesn‚Äôt have flame thrower or a razorback."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Finally We Get Some Info On Toru's Father
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Movie looks alright, but this trailer feels very spoiler-y."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Michal Myers had better trailers then this
dSBsNeYqh-k,So trying to rip off Hallow Man with Kevin Bacon now huh?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Well, the black dude didn‚Äôt make it...again. And she kills her husband at the end."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"too much information, and I feel like they had an good concept, but didn't do the best job with it. I think it would've been cool if they made it a possibility that she was legit crazy, but it's almost just proven for her to not be."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Wow, things keep getting worse for June! üî¥"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Twist. It's a woman, and it's his mistress. He is dead, but his mistress is not."
dSBsNeYqh-k,This part of universals dark universe revival?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Really regret watching this trailer. I actually wanted to enjoy the movie without knowing everything that happens
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This is such an interesting concept for a movie, so I really hope to see it executed well"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Beyond f***ing awful!!! You have discovered a god-like power... What do you do with it? 
Oh yea, re-enact Sleeping with the Enemy but with Invisibility... Utter shite!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Glad Universal is going to do something different from the Dork Universe, but this trailer was concentrated spoiler fuel. Like, how the hell do you show too much of an invisible man?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,üíØ
dSBsNeYqh-k,Damn offred finally got out of Gilead only to fight off a invisible Man
dSBsNeYqh-k,I'm sure that when he 'farts' in cold weather you can visibly see the exsaust fumes as he's approaching...vvroom!!!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Hey at least they didn't go the usual route of lying to you and tricking you into buying a ticket. They let you know what its about, and I actually appreciate that. At least some of the things in this trailer I can expect to be in the movie."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Kinda still wanna see it but the ending ruined it for me. Could've been a great movie but nooo. Really hoping I forget so I can see it without being spoiled.
dSBsNeYqh-k,So a guy has the ability to be invisible .......yet he chooses to stalk and physically harras a semi good looking lady. ü§îSeems a bit unbelievable.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"How many old books are getting movies now?
And how many of them will I just HAPPEN to read in class?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,They should have just called it  Hollow man 2 2020
dSBsNeYqh-k,The trailer just gave away the whole plot of the film. So his not dead but actually created something to become invincible. I just saw the whole movie in 2 minutes.
dSBsNeYqh-k,I swear to god every time a trailer for anything drops all of the ‚ÄúwElL yOu jUsT sHoWeD uS tHe wHoLe mOvIe‚Äù dweebs come out of their holes just to comment lmao
dSBsNeYqh-k,If I were her I'd get alotta paint.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Damn that was a good movie üçø
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I can see why Johnny Depp isn't rolling in this. Honestly was exited for this horror film, till I saw the cops being attacked, there is no horror, no mystery, just plain action & drama.
And why is universal tryin to make a horror film?!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,You all saying dat but don‚Äôt be surprised when there‚Äôs a badass twist or some shit ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
dSBsNeYqh-k,TRAILERS ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO SHOW THE WHOLE MOVIE
dSBsNeYqh-k,*i'm the invisible man*
dSBsNeYqh-k,The trailer should of been 5 seconds long. ‚ÄúSomeone‚Äôs sitting in that chair‚Äù camera shows chair. I‚Äôm sold! But no they had to show the whole damn movie.
dSBsNeYqh-k,The trailer is the whole movie dawg
dSBsNeYqh-k,it's Kevin Bacon üòÅ
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks meh
dSBsNeYqh-k,Felt like I just watched the whole movie.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Wish I didn't see this trailer.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Bruh, I just saw one of those YouTube ad trailers for this movie, and I got to say, I was very impressed. It creeped me tf out. Well done"
dSBsNeYqh-k,In a world where nobody invented thermal lenses
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks so fake but I don't know why üòÇüòÇüòÇ
dSBsNeYqh-k,I've thought this movie is a Hollowman 2
dSBsNeYqh-k,Universal Monsters here we come üî•
dSBsNeYqh-k,Damn definitely a must see
dSBsNeYqh-k,Has people ever heard of DIVORCES?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Kevin Bacon's at it again? Sheesh...
dSBsNeYqh-k,IM SO FUCKING HYPED FOR THIS AND THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW I HOPE THEY DONT FLOP
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hang beaded curtains from every possible inch of ceiling space. Problem solved. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
dSBsNeYqh-k,So glad I don‚Äôt have to see the movie now.. these short films are really great time savers. Idiots
dSBsNeYqh-k,Holy shit I had chills watching this whole trailer
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Damn, that trailer lasted like FOREVER!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Another great movie ruined by it's own trailer. Trailer should have been making me question if she's insane. The twist is that everyone was wrong and the man WAS infact invisible. Would have watched this with my wife. Tsk tsk. Please do better. Feels like trailers aren't even trying anymore.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Why would you ruin the mystery
dSBsNeYqh-k,the director of this movie is a cornchip
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Damn, I love it when movie trailers ruin the mystery
No but seriously, really trailer? Really? You could‚Äôve given the audience a ride, but no, you chose to ruin it in the very end of the trailer by showing that she‚Äôs not crazy and her ex boyfriend is actually invisible"
dSBsNeYqh-k,The visible trailer
dSBsNeYqh-k,Oop
dSBsNeYqh-k,Nothing on Kevin Bacon
dSBsNeYqh-k,Carry around a can of spray paint...
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Even though this trailer shoes almost the whole movie, but still I'm going to watch this movie in cinema! Like, if you're too"
dSBsNeYqh-k,H.G. Wells must be vomiting in his grave.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Am I planning on seeing this movie? *Yes*

Can I predict what's gonna happen? *Also yes*"
dSBsNeYqh-k,2/10 no Claude Rains
dSBsNeYqh-k,Bruh just throw paint on the dude
dSBsNeYqh-k,Whos the actor that played the invisible man? I couldn't see him.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"The actor who played the invisible man was so good, he was unrecognizable. Oscar contender for 2021."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hope it doesn‚Äôt suck as bad as the Mummy.  I‚Äôd like to see more Dark Universe and less stupid super hero movies
dSBsNeYqh-k,"1933: ""I wanted to do something tremendous, to achieve what men of science have dreamt of since the world began. To gain wealth and fame and honor, to write my name above the greatest scientists of all time.""

2020: ""I wanted to torment my ex."""
dSBsNeYqh-k,What kind of stupid make this trail.. it s a 2mlnutes summery of all movie.. why should watch it after seeing this...
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks really cool. I‚Äôll watch and most likely enjoy but trailer shows way too much
dSBsNeYqh-k,You might as well release the whole dam movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,this seems ripe for a Ryan Higa parody
dSBsNeYqh-k,"They gave away the fact that he is actually invisible, but it still looks extremely entertaining!!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I saw the trailer for this when I went to see 1917, and I honestly thought it was a comedy at first. Even though the plot is about a manipulative abuser, my mind instantly sidetracked into how impractical invisibility would be. Like, imagine all the seemingly mundane things that we do daily, that would be difficult to impossible for someone who was invisible. Like, how would he travel? Or see a doctor if he was ill? Or even use the bathroom? Could you imagine walking into a public restroom, only to find a shit being taken by someone you couldn‚Äôt see? Additionally you‚Äôd basically be alone, as no one can see you and the only person who acknowledges your existence is your ex who everything thinks is crazy. It‚Äôd basically be worse than death."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Lately I find myself not wanting to actually go out and see intriguing-looking movies bc of just how much trailers reveal nowadays. You know how much more eerie this trailer could have been just showing one snippet of the invisible guy? This is not how you market your movie. Less is better sometimes.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"He's a psychopath, but that's to be expected because even in the original H.G. Wells novel, whatever it is that renders them invisible, MAKES them crazy! (ALWAYS the ""price you pay"" for being a ""monster""!) So, ""The Dark Universe"" (although officially scrapped) is back up and running...Hopefully, without ""Mr. Hyde""... Looks interesting..."
dSBsNeYqh-k,what a fucked up trailer for a promising movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,"If he is able to touch her, she must be able to touch back.  SO, when she cries that there is someone in the room, she simply needs to touch or have someone else touch him to prove her case.  Premise is FLAWED.  Bad storyline from the start.   Check out the original movie."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I really want this universe to work, but Universal needs to pick it up"
dSBsNeYqh-k,I'm just thinking about a makes man with glasses now I can't take it seriously
dSBsNeYqh-k,"What producers settle for these days is a crime against culture... not just this one... it's only another one. ""That's what you brought here..?"""
dSBsNeYqh-k,So no one thought of the Old Movie Hallow Man?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Good movies i like it
dSBsNeYqh-k,Cloak technology
dSBsNeYqh-k,Trailer gave away too much of the movie! It could‚Äôve been a 1 minute long trailer and it would‚Äôve still caught my interest.
dSBsNeYqh-k,1:42 holy shit is that Leigh whannell?!!!
dSBsNeYqh-k,Well why buy a ticket when I just saw the whole movie in 2 min...üòï
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Anything to the ""Dark Universe""?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollywood presents...how to ruin another classic movie.
dSBsNeYqh-k,guys its a remake lol chill out
dSBsNeYqh-k,Time to give Harry Potter his invisible cloak back.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow man is way better
dSBsNeYqh-k,"""Hey lets make a psychological thriller with twists and turns but tell you THE ENTIRE FUCKING PLOT OF THE MOVIE IN THE TRAILER"""
dSBsNeYqh-k,Right when I was enjoying this trailer and thought hey I might watch it.. they literally ruin the whole mystery and intrigue of the premise. Why the fuck would you do that
dSBsNeYqh-k,Thanks universal studios now I don‚Äôt need to go and see the movie since it‚Äôs all in the fucking trailer
dSBsNeYqh-k,Somebody gonna transition from invisible to visible from hurting somebody.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I was excited about this movie during the trailer and midway I‚Äôm like their showing a little too much I can‚Äôt wait to see it tho, then BOOM I watched the whole movie in a trailer so now I could careless.  Smh I was excited too man"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks Stupid
dSBsNeYqh-k,Scary trailer!  This movie may be about Electronic Gangstalking....
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Ehh.  I'd much rather have a ""Dracula Untold"" sequel or ""the Wolfman"".  Hell I just wanted the damn Dark Universe!!!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this another Dark Universe reboot?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow Man yall
dSBsNeYqh-k,Blumhouse fnaf skips another dark universe film okkie dokie
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I think I may support this - with reticence...I think there should be, I dunno, some sort of humour injected into it because a B movie flavor that can be folded into the recipe would probably stoke me up a bit more. I think Universal has a real opportunity here (although the Mummy was just fucked from day one) I think the formula is there, it exists. So implementing that bit of B Movie spice would certainly help to create a well written throughline that piques interests and pleases audiences. But I dunno, that's just me."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Taking one of the greatest literary classics ever and making it some cheap, suspense thriller about domestic violence is a new low."
dSBsNeYqh-k,u r showing waaaay too much
dSBsNeYqh-k,Soooooo is this part of the Dark Universe? ü§î
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks like the type of movie that never actually gets released
dSBsNeYqh-k,It's cool their making a movie about john cena
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Please, Leigh Whannell, dont fuck this up."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Yeah, that's not what the Invisible Man is about, at all. What a load of shit."
dSBsNeYqh-k,That's a hard pass for me ü§∑
dSBsNeYqh-k,I don‚Äôt know if this is intriguing or completely stupid
dSBsNeYqh-k,Why does it feel like I have just seen the entire movie? Great trailer though!
dSBsNeYqh-k,So then we saw every good part of the movie in the trailer. Moving on...
dSBsNeYqh-k,I prefer the Claude Rains movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,"sooooooooooooooo excited, i can't wait to see that film"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Everybody: you just gave away the movie.
Me: it's called THE INVISIBLE MAN; the plot is right there in the title."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Looks terrible.  Of all the things that could be done with the invisible man (see ""The Boys"") this isn't on the list."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This looked really good, I REALLY wanted to see it. Then you revealed the reveal in the trailer and i decided i‚Äôll wait till it‚Äôs on netflix. Fire your trailer editor."
dSBsNeYqh-k,why do trailers reveal so much
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow man 3. Still it looks good tho
dSBsNeYqh-k,Thanks for showing the whole fuckin movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,"The audience could‚Äôve had the ‚Äúmaybe she‚Äôs crazy, or maybe it‚Äôs real?‚Äù Throughout the whole movie.. But noooo lets give it away in the trailer. Smart."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Why would they give it away that he‚Äôs actually real? So stupid. Not watching this movie now, no point to."
dSBsNeYqh-k,somewhere llese it looks like adaptation of telugu movie avunu. even last dialogue is there in that movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This movie looks fucking stupid. The blonde bitch is a shitty actor with a role that shouldn‚Äôt even exist. What is this? Some hallmark or lmn film? The film should be about the invisible man, not some dumb wife in some stupid stalker who just happens to be invisible. Who gives a fuck about her. Let the bitch die two mins in.... damn it, this shit sucks"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Reminds Me Of 100 Feet (2008)
dSBsNeYqh-k,Frankenstein remake plz
dSBsNeYqh-k,Caralho!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I think we just saw the entire movie, right up to the point where she exposes the invisible man and is vindicated.  No need to actually see this one."
dSBsNeYqh-k,This trailer just showed the whole movie! I wanna see that invisible man's face tho ~ people are still going to watch it and they know that
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Nice concept, but it kind of loses its power when you think of a solution. If you got a bag of flour or glitter or something and just through it all over the place when you found a mark, then it would outline him, that shit sticks to everything, he'd be very visible. You can't build a horror movie when the ex machina can be glitter."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"So is this supposed to be sort of based on H.G Wells' book ""The Invisible Man"" or just another story completely. Because if its supposed to be based off the book I'm sorry to tell you, this is NOTHING like the book like.. AT ALL"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Bro... wasn't this movie already a thing with Kevin Bacon
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow Man
dSBsNeYqh-k,A movie about an abusive man going invisible interesting
dSBsNeYqh-k,Why doesn‚Äôt she just use spray paint?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Download: https://www.vidpaw.com/download/dSBsNeYqh-k/
dSBsNeYqh-k,"The one freaking time (and I mean literally) I put my trust into trailers not ruining the movie, I get this shit."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Okay can someone explain to me how they confirmed that he is dead with evidence of his body via pictures and ashes but, he was able to ""Transcend"" and become invisible? My only explanation is someone else jump into the machine and killed Adrian. The motive maybe is to make the Main Character look crazy so she doesn't get the 5 million and it defaults to the next person. Anyway, ill be there watching this in February but yall won't see me LMFAO!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Alright free movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,Can I please be hired to edit your movie trailer. This was not a trailer. IT WAS THE WHOLE FILM. The only thing invisible here is the credits at the end of this trailer.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Spoiler Alert: John Cena is her ex.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Invest in some thermal optics girl!
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is it from the book or brandnew?
dSBsNeYqh-k,all men are bad: the movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,I honestly want to know why trailers are revealing so much these days. Does this actually convert to more ticket buys?
dSBsNeYqh-k,You mean bs  hollow man idea
dSBsNeYqh-k,So. . . It‚Äôs Hollow Man?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I'm the invisible Man
I'm the invisible Man
It's incredible how you can
See right through me"
dSBsNeYqh-k,0:18 LET ME TALK TO YOOUU
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I really hope the bad guy wins in this one, the woman is horrible and I don‚Äôt want them to kill the invisible man, is a great villain lol"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Gee, I wonder what happens in this movie..."
dSBsNeYqh-k,legend has it that even if John Cena wears a whole camo uniform you still wont be able to see him üëÄüò≠
dSBsNeYqh-k,Does anyone knows if this is the film that's supposed to be continue and connect to the mummy film with tom cruise on making that whole monster extended universe???
dSBsNeYqh-k,...my name is Cecilia...
dSBsNeYqh-k,Im guessing the point of this was to wonder if she really was crazy. ...
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks awesome to me.
dSBsNeYqh-k,The new addition to marvel
dSBsNeYqh-k,Even though I know the whole plot i still want to see how it's executed.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Another cool , Plot twist she‚Äôs imagining everything and has two personalities lol"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"How does someone take a fascinating idea like an invisible person, and turn it into two hours of misandry? Of all the plot lines possible. Pathetically timely."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Wasn‚Äôt this supposed to be a trailer and not the whole movie. This is almost as bad as the Birds of prey trailer...
dSBsNeYqh-k,Wow that's the best MOVIE I ever seen
dSBsNeYqh-k,Kevin Bacon or gtfo.
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is how you should not make a trailer. Good job. Everybody watched the whole movie for free.
dSBsNeYqh-k,What is this the 900th remake of this damn movie ?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Awesome trailer
dSBsNeYqh-k,Bucket o‚Äô paint. Seems fairly simple to me.
dSBsNeYqh-k,I am not familiar with Scientology but she is a great actor.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Whoever made this trailer needs to be fired lmao
dSBsNeYqh-k,"realx everybody
This is made by the same man who made upgrade and  insidious. i am sure there are many twists that are not shown in the trailer"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"My God, what a shitty trailer. I don‚Äôt even need to watch this movie anymore. I already know the entirety of the plot. Guy ‚Äúdies‚Äù. Wife starts ‚Äúhallucinating‚Äù he isn‚Äôt dead. We find out he isn‚Äôt, he‚Äôs just invisible because of an invention he made. He tortures her by scaring her for a long time, probably because he‚Äôs either crazy or she‚Äôs crazy and abused him. Her family and friends avoid her. She goes to the police. They don‚Äôt believe her. He kills them. They fight. Wife kills him. End of story. 

I fucking hate how they do this with every potentially good thriller/horror film. This could have been something to look forward to. Is she crazy and hallucinating her husband‚Äôs ghost? Is he in an alternate dimension? Did someone fake his death to avoid the discovery of this invisibilty invention? Military research? Aliens? 

But noooOoooOooOO, you just had to fuck up all of the anticipation with a trailer that spoils the entire goddamn story. Fuck this."

What else are they supposed to call it! And the trailer only showed two and a half minutes of the runtime; plenty of the rest of the runtime can absolutely subvert your expectations, regardless of the main point of the plot. Don‚Äôt throw out the steak just because you might know how it tastes!"

dSBsNeYqh-k,If this is cannon with the dark universe i wont see it
dSBsNeYqh-k,Trailer ends at 1:20 (Watch any further you'll spoil the whole movie for yourself)
dSBsNeYqh-k,trailers like these who needs to watch the movie. good job Universal Pictures
dSBsNeYqh-k,I definitely wouldn't mind seeing this.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"very, very,very loosely based on the book by hg wells...btw the way when are we going to see the invisible man by ralph ellison made into a movie? now that might actually be something special"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"The producers should release the poster as it is now, but if you turn your brightness up on your computer you can see the silhouet of The Invisible Man behind Elisabeth Moss. I've tried it instandly when I saw the poster and I was dissapointed it dind't work. Would be great as a marketing trick."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow Man 3?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Wow we just watched the whole movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,I thought the Dark Universe was dead
dSBsNeYqh-k,Think of all the free poony you could have if you were invisible...hahah Every man alive would  be watching every hot girl get naked....Plus fuckin with her head like this guy does.

dSBsNeYqh-k,Utterly boring. Please try to imagine original ideas. I know it‚Äôs difficult but please try.
dSBsNeYqh-k,God I hate it when trailers turn to Lifetime spoiler type trailers ...........
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Why does Universal ruin their movies by spoiling the whole goddamn thing in one trailer? They did the same thing with Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom. Jesus christ, leave some of it for the theater."
dSBsNeYqh-k,It's never a good sign when they decide to show the whole film within the trailer. Generally means they're worried it wont do well.
dSBsNeYqh-k,0:37 Token black guy. How diverse...
dSBsNeYqh-k,That‚Äôs what they want YOU to think!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Well, at least the trailer showed me the entire movie, so I don't have to see it. So there's that."
dSBsNeYqh-k,cool movie...thanks for the free showing
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This is exactly the same as Hollow Man.

The one difference seems to be that in this new one the guy fakes his death before going invisible, while in Hollow Man, his coworkers know he's become invisible."

What I hate about this movie is that it‚Äôs coming in February when it should be coming in October. I‚Äôve said this before and it bears repeating we need stuff to watch at Halloween.

I had never heard of it and I was damn excited to see the mystery in the trailer, but equally dissapointed as major reveals such as the length the antagonist is willing to go through and answering my questions before I could even ask them (attacking a guard and such; her finding a machine and also revealing a plausible explanation), all within the trailer.

I really want to watch the movie but like most I feel like I just did, and protecting the idea by saying its a well known story kinda spoils it for me, believing this was an original idea and getting to experience it for the first time.

Its a shame because I could imagine those who love the original would also want other people to experience it for the first time, yet at the same time I feel judged for not having heard about it"

dSBsNeYqh-k,Dummyüëé
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I'm the invisible man bitch 
Kevin Bacon hold my beer"
dSBsNeYqh-k,You know what really sucks? This movie looks pretty good but the trailer completely ruins it all. Now when I‚Äôm watching it in the theater I‚Äôm not gonna be off the edge of my seat or something cause I already know what‚Äôs gonna happen. I don‚Äôt agree when ppl say they don‚Äôt make good horror/thriller movies anymore they just don‚Äôt make good trailers.
dSBsNeYqh-k,PROMISING!!!
dSBsNeYqh-k,I would complain that the trailer showed to much and ruin the twist but this is a reboot and Blumhouse is trying to do that monster universe . Also that it‚Äôs called the invisible man there‚Äôs gonna be one so what‚Äôs the point even trying to make that twist that‚Äôs she‚Äôs crazy
dSBsNeYqh-k,The Invisible Hand
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow man is back
dSBsNeYqh-k,"alright you fools you brought this on yourselves, everything would have gone as plan only if you left me alone, youve driven me mad with your constant interruption and peering through the keyhole and now you'll suffer for it! YOUR CRAZY TO KNOW WHO I AM AREN'T YOU?!......oh wait better movie"

dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow Man received an Apple Update
dSBsNeYqh-k,I prefer the book by James Baldwin. I mean I'll still watch out of curiosity
dSBsNeYqh-k,He's just mad his wife wants that BBC from that black guy
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This trailer showed WAY too much. Where my interest may have been piqued by a less revealing trailer, I now feel like I don't have to bother with this film."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"If this succeeds, will Universal officially cancel Elizabeth Banks's Invisible Woman?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Do yla'll want me to kill y'all with my sweets.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Kevin Jacob's dick: I hope this movie sucks.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Amazing how they take a classic story and bend it into a stalker/ home invasion piece of shit for 17 year olds. We are so going wrong and the future is REALLY going to suck.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Guys it‚Äôs obviously just Harry Potter fucking with her with his stupid invisible cloak
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This takes fear of the unknown to a whole new level üò≥







then the trailer ruined it....."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I don‚Äôt need to see this movie.




*Because you just showed it to me*"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Dude the invisible man is...
Will Smith (UwU)"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Well that was a good 2 min movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,"If Drax isn‚Äôt in it, it‚Äôs terrible."
dSBsNeYqh-k,*NO MORE HORROR REMAKES*
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks like hollow man part 2
dSBsNeYqh-k,HallowMan.........
dSBsNeYqh-k,A lot of people in the comments saying the trailer shows the whole movie...the most interesting thing actually might be how he learns invisibility.  Or something interesting like that.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Less is more.. y‚Äôall basically spoiled the movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow Man Great Value ü§®
dSBsNeYqh-k,"That woman is so damn ugly. Please stop it with the ugly, ugly feminist democrats."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Yeah from the trailer we can expect the whole plot but maybe there would be a twist..who knows
dSBsNeYqh-k,Drax wtf? Why would u do this?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Lmao I don‚Äôt gotta see the movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,A nigga really used the splash potion of  invisibility huh
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Too much movie shown here...But let's me honest, I wasn't gonna see this at the movies anyway."
dSBsNeYqh-k,She‚Äôs so hot  üòç
dSBsNeYqh-k,Wow short movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,This movie looks like shit
dSBsNeYqh-k,Cool and lame as hell concept at the same time...
dSBsNeYqh-k,"So we go from a story of a tortured man that loses his humanity, and identity after trying to stop his professor from stealing more of his ideas leading him to self experimentation to an already crazed, and sick abuser with no redeeming qualities."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"There are so many plot  possibilities  for an invisible man movie. 
Spying on behalf of international security, industrial espionage , breaking  the bank at Vegas , and this is the best they could come up with. An invisible psycho stalker. Who wants to sit through an hour and a half of this crap?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this basically just Hollow Man?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"The invisible man

Really üòëüòëüòë"
dSBsNeYqh-k,No point watching the film. Everyone knows what gonna happen thanks to the trailer
dSBsNeYqh-k,Never knew this was coming out until they showed it on tv today... I'll give it a watch
dSBsNeYqh-k,üòÇüòÇüòÇGuys be good to women then shit like this will happen to them crazy bitch lol
dSBsNeYqh-k,I refuse to believe market research was conducted to determine if people gave a shit about The Invisible Man.  This is why I firmly believe a good amount of films are money laundering vehicles for Chinese oligarchs.
dSBsNeYqh-k,I thought this was a joke at first. It looks so bad.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Unless this movie has a close-up shot of Emily Blunt's hoo-hah, then I'm not remotely interested in going to see it."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"When the preview shows you this much, you know the movie is going to be a flop ""Please come see our movie !"" Puh-leaze!!!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Can‚Äôt wait for the rape scene. Wait what???
dSBsNeYqh-k,So there remaking the movie:Nice
dSBsNeYqh-k,It will always bother me that The Dark Universe never happened.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow Man 2.0
dSBsNeYqh-k,El senor de los cielos 7 capitulo 50
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hammer vs Gun?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This better be connected to the Mummy, and is Jonnhy Deep the Invisible man?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Omg soooooooo gonna see this !
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I love trailers that show whole stupid movie, now I don't have to waste $.
Isn't this the same stupid plot where Fred Flintstone can see the great kazoo but no one else can?
Or was that the singing frog who only sings without an audience? 
Seems like I've seen this many many times. Yawn"
dSBsNeYqh-k,The Dark Universe is back.
dSBsNeYqh-k,This trailer just gave away the fucking ending
dSBsNeYqh-k,DOWNLOAD NEW MOVIE. https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCR7atew1BRTtar_nftb2wRA
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Y'all, i bet there's a twist somewhere"
dSBsNeYqh-k,The question is still intact. Why no use IR goggles?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"A hottie like Adrian,Invisible yet,stalks and Wants this Ugly ass,flat butt,flat chested,yellow teethed,poorly educated,financially strapped,Woman.Or does this fall into that tired she's a natural blonde therefore desirable category?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,So *THIS* is what happened to Jeffrey Epstein
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I understand that it's almost Impossible to produce the quality of Universals original Invisible Man movies=Claude Raines,Jon Hall,Vincent Price respectfully,But WHY are They trying to Make us believe an Invisible Man,Who can have ANY woman he wants,Wants that Ugly ass,tired looking sallow faced woman,NoT very believable."
dSBsNeYqh-k,I just found this movie in that random DVD bin in the middle of the aisle at Walmart next to the rotisserie chickens.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Stupid trailer shows too much of the movie. Trailer maker should be fired.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This Invisible Man is a sick fuck!!
All the others were cool."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Most elaborate hide and seek game
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Welp just watched, time to go see Dark Waters I guess"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Where‚Äôs the Creature from the Black Lagoon remake!?!?!
dSBsNeYqh-k,What is it with Blumhouse and spoiling the whole movie in its trailers?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Good to see Universal isn't giving up on the horror film genre after The Mummy tanked
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Thanks, I don't have to watch the movie."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Universal could have started with this, but nope, they did ""The Mummy"" and that's why your franchise is dead"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Did I just watch the entire movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,like the hollow man
dSBsNeYqh-k,Eat a bunch of sloppy Joes and wait to see what part of the room  the gagging noises come from
dSBsNeYqh-k,Lady it's called spray paint use it.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Sad its not the Ralph Ellison book.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Parece muito bom
dSBsNeYqh-k,Will this lead into the universal monsters? Or are you all done with that i feel like it can work just more thought n effort
dSBsNeYqh-k,The invisible man is just a Minecraft player who drank a potion of invisibility that lasts forever.
dSBsNeYqh-k,The only way they could twist this plot after revealing everything in the trailer is if she really is crazy and they use flashbacks at the end to show that she killed him and everyone else. She basically developed a split personality from the abusive relationship. I don't know man. I'm trying to be optimistic here and hoping they didn't just ruin the movie for us all.
dSBsNeYqh-k,This isn‚Äôt the whole movie guys y‚Äôall need to read the book
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hopefully he's only invisible and not also invincible.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Well damn I don't need to pay and see it now!? üò†
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Welp, that was a good movie. Basically showed it all. Next!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is both a good trailer and a bad trailer
dSBsNeYqh-k,there is probably more that they are not showing us so i'm still optimistic about this movie because i just want it to succed because i have so much love for the universal monsters and that fanchise overall
dSBsNeYqh-k,Incredible how he can
dSBsNeYqh-k,ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ÿßŸÉÿ®ÿ±
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I got ""Avunu"" telugu movie in my mind while watching this trailer."
dSBsNeYqh-k,DRACULA 2¬°¬°¬°¬°
dSBsNeYqh-k,Thanks for the free movie Universal.
dSBsNeYqh-k,It's fun to see the Sydney skyline jumbled into San Francisco in the view from the office there... very like The Matrix. Rest of the film looks OK too.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"You should change your Releasing Date in past, that way you will be able to save your dignity, 
*bcoz everybody knows your plot*"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this trailer or movie you've showed whole movie in this trailer even Ending too üòí but still i am going to watch this
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this Hollow man 3 or Reboot
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks pretty good actually.
dSBsNeYqh-k,revealed waaaaaay to much
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Hahahah Nah this isn't my invisible man.  Give me Claude Rains any day. That invisible man will always be number one, not this stacker wanna be with this lame recycled plot."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow man 3
dSBsNeYqh-k,"When trailer starts I thought ""oh no.Another generic ghost horror""
In middle of trailer""ooh.Perhaps main character is crazy""
At the edd of a trailer""Ahh.It is about invisible man"""
dSBsNeYqh-k,But why the film is still invisible in net
dSBsNeYqh-k,"what no dark universe logo?


OOOOHHH TOO SOOOON~?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks........really good! THIS is how you do a remake of a Universal Classic. EAT YOUR HEART OUT THE MUMMY (2016)!
dSBsNeYqh-k,I stg 2:07 had me rolling üòÇüòÇ
dSBsNeYqh-k,They fucked up the whole story it would be awesome if it is wholly based on the noval written by H.G Wells.
dSBsNeYqh-k,So basically Elisabeth Moss has the same role like in Mad Men xD
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I loved this Novel in my High School
Pretty excited for the actual visual movie üòçüòç"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Expectting the wolfman and Dracula movie to come out soon lol
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I thought either Armie Hammer or Alexander Skarsgard were portraying the Invisible Man?

This looks like another ""Hollow Man"" regardless."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I fucking hate movie trailers spoiling so much anymore.  This looks like a great movie but seriously.  The only trailers I'll watch are for Marvel movies since they take steps to purposely alter them and not spoil the shit out of them, and they aren't even the kinds of movies that really can get spoiled like this!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Yea they shouldn't have revealed the damn secret of him bein invisible
dSBsNeYqh-k,"It's the director of Upgrade, and starring Elisabeth Moss and seeing her like this 1:24 makes me think Stanley Kubrick would have casted her in a movie."
dSBsNeYqh-k,If its trying to do a fake out with the psychological thing why did u put spoilers in your trailer? Oh no...someone did a big fuck up
dSBsNeYqh-k,Start dark universe movies again We are waiting impatiently
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I'm awed that someone as bad as this trailer's editor is getting payed. If that's not a Disney story, I don't know what is."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this a reboot to the original invisible man
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I have to say that Universal's ""Dark Universe"" movie franchise was off to a horrible start with The Mummy, but this looks more promising."
dSBsNeYqh-k,If only she has a can of silly string
dSBsNeYqh-k,This > https://www.instagram.com/p/B5LXSoEF8Xo/ ...is scarier than this entire trailer and all you get is a TITLE!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"God, just throw paint on him!!!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"1:24 - Jeez... With a face like that, she‚Äôd pass for a decent looking female version of Pennywise or a possessed extra in a potential Truth or Dare 2."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"They'd better have a really fucking impressive reason how one guy managed to come up with super-stealth technology 100 years more advanced than anything modern science can do, without anywhere near the budget or research, and why he has super-strength."
dSBsNeYqh-k,I can see whole movie from this trailer..
dSBsNeYqh-k,Interesting movie. But I think you have spoiled it to me. So I don't need to watch it
dSBsNeYqh-k,New drax movie looks legit üëå
dSBsNeYqh-k,https://youtu.be/Fb7ReZOhvlw
dSBsNeYqh-k,"With a 1.2 million dollar budget (according to IMDb as of today) guess everybody more or less worked for free or had their mothers make cookies and bring coffee.  I think this movie will still lose money even at that budget.  My answer to the invisible man is get under a tall building, have your ex choke you and then have your platonic girlfriend dump blue paint on him from the roof and then the black cop shoots him and you can roll credits and the one guy in the audience can go home."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Lmao just throw some flour on his ass, it‚Äôll stick and make the dude visible"
dSBsNeYqh-k,THE INVISIBLE MAN (2020) LOOKS LIKE A GOOD HORROR REMAKE OF THE 1933 FILM.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Finally Hollywood copied from tollywood https://youtu.be/R2tv9lAvKGY
dSBsNeYqh-k,The Invisible Man Of Queen....¬ø?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Toll paid in full.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Active camo ready..
dSBsNeYqh-k,"It's copied from Indian Telugu movie title was ""AVUNU"""
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is Telugu movie Remake that movie name is (*Avunu*)
dSBsNeYqh-k,Nothing wrong with a bag of cash floating out of the local bank !ü§ë
dSBsNeYqh-k,"That caveat, would make me run from that money, looks to me like he hired someone to gaslight her?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,They should rename. This is NOT like the Universal movie and it should be like it.
dSBsNeYqh-k,So remember the film hollowman 2000
dSBsNeYqh-k,Sanji
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Zzzzzzzzzzzzz. Even Holloman was a better idea than this. Misses the concept the entire point of HG Wells work, not to mention the whale film. Been there, seen it, see you later."
dSBsNeYqh-k,That is a very unfortunate looking woman.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"What's the best way to kill them








With a noose"
dSBsNeYqh-k,When you have a bottle of spray paint
dSBsNeYqh-k,So much for the classic horror monster movie universe reboot.
dSBsNeYqh-k,the soundtrack could be the song The Invisible Man
dSBsNeYqh-k,I read the book as a kid.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Way to ruin the movie, trailer."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I'm so sick of seeing Elizabeth Moss in almost EVERY fucking movie. Ever since her breakthrough role in her mediocre show, Handmaiden's Tale, this ugly bitch is fucking EVERYWHERE. 

My main complaint is actually physical: She's not an attractive woman. Good actress, but she's not pretty at all. It's hard to take her seriously in these roles when she's just ugly and every other main actress in these films is good looking. 

It may sound stupid, but movies are 90% aesthetics and she simply does NOT fit that mold at all. Stop putting her in movies üòÇü§£"
dSBsNeYqh-k,TELUGU MOVIE AVUNU REMAKEüëåüëåüëå
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Um... Whoever in Hollywood is Green lighting these ""trailers"" that literally shows the entire film needs to be fired."
dSBsNeYqh-k,I am sold!!!
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks like a good film. Too bad there's no point watching it anymore after seeing the entire thing condensed into two and a half minutes of what are probably all the best scenes.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Ohh Mr.India ka remakeüòÇü§£
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is invisible man film a sequel of Hollow Man.?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Why she has to go to his house at night and alone
dSBsNeYqh-k,I just saw this trailer and I said Ive watched this movie its really good where was it netflix? Then realised last week I saw the trailerü§£ü§£  I feel bad for the producers the trailer is so good who want to sit an hour+ to watch the full thing‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è
dSBsNeYqh-k,_If this girl is hallucinating for the entire movie and this is all in her head I'd be delightfully surprised_
dSBsNeYqh-k,"It is ""avunu"" Telugu remake movie üòÇ"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"interesting, but unfortunately, it seems like trailer spoiled the whole movie."
dSBsNeYqh-k,So they just rebooted hollow man
dSBsNeYqh-k,What was he eating
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Y'all didn't need to put the entire movie in the trailer. Doing dumb shit like this is why the Mummy bombed. Better have him beat her in the end as the suprise ending. Like everyone dying gets pinned on her going crazy, they lock her up on death row, and he goes out into the world to wreak havoc. I want a God damn dark ending to a horror movie for once."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Why is the protagonist a female when the film is called ""The Invisible Man""? Why are they stealing the title from the original classic? They should all die horrible deaths especially Leigh Whannell. I can't stand his stupidity now. He used to be awesome."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Super
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Hollywood ->> invisible man üò±
Bollywood  ->> Mr. India   üòç"
dSBsNeYqh-k,This ought to be the male version of ‚Äúgone girl‚Äù
dSBsNeYqh-k,No need to watch this awesome looking movie because the awesome trailer ruined it.
dSBsNeYqh-k,The movie is truly inspired from a Telugu Movie called :Avunu
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Hmmm, wasn't this a plot for an episode of Batman: The Animated Series?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Pretty good ‚ùóÔ∏è
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is Indian Film name Called 'Avunu'.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Everyone gangster ‚Äòtil jah gets his own movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,Translucent‚Äôs new movie is gonna be DOPEEEE.. btw when is he getting back from active duty?

dSBsNeYqh-k,Look like same situation plot hollow man Kevin bacon yr2000
dSBsNeYqh-k,Impressive
dSBsNeYqh-k,I wish they'd do a classic like this as a period piece.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Whoever is responsible for this trailer will be fired big time and probably rightfully.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Plot exposed... was excited..no longer interested!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Is she ok? It‚Äôs seem not movie 
Leave her out right now"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"They get invisible and all they're able to do is stock some old, ugly, out of shape granny with a black pet and a dog.. funny!!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Rrdofodgf
dSBsNeYqh-k,Well Kevin Costner's experiment did go successful and now his cousin's after you..be prepared for the genius...
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Just watched the whole movie, thanks."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This is indian movie remake , movie name is AVUNU"
dSBsNeYqh-k,I think we have RedLetterMedia to thank for giving Jason Blum the idea.  Much better than that horrible Tom Cruise Mummy disaster.
dSBsNeYqh-k,That guy is gonna be really disappointed if he ever lets a fart slip
dSBsNeYqh-k,Finally Hollow man sequel
dSBsNeYqh-k,Where i can watch the full movie? Tnx

dSBsNeYqh-k,That‚Äôs creepy. Anyway whole plot exposed. Now people believe he is alive.
dSBsNeYqh-k,I just saw the whole fucking movie in the trailer
dSBsNeYqh-k,"A feature film is an hour or more in length.
Trailers these days: Hold my beer."
dSBsNeYqh-k,A film about my favorite man running around completely naked.
dSBsNeYqh-k,In Telugu language movie AVUNU
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Technically, an invisible person should be blind."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I think, it is taken from the reference of 'AVUNU' Telugu movie"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Ok so the invisible Man is a stalking, weak minded creep who found a way to become invisible only too terrorize his ex and get me too'd! NEXT!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,I wish they  casted Johny depp as invisible man
dSBsNeYqh-k,This trailer would have been so much better if we didn't know if she was crazy or he actually was invisible.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Looks good, but who ever edited this trailer showed me the whole move. Time to save my money"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Dark universe üòãüñ§üñ§üñ§

dSBsNeYqh-k,Great acting by JOHN CENA.
dSBsNeYqh-k,downvote this for showing the fucking plot
dSBsNeYqh-k,okay so i was interested in this movie but the trailer pretty much spoiled the whole thing.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"BRO, THIS BE THE ONLY MOVIE WITH NO MOTION SENSOR IN THE HOUSE"
dSBsNeYqh-k,I just saw a trailer or whole movie.
dSBsNeYqh-k,wow free movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,I have to stop watching the trailer midway because it was revealing too much of the story...
dSBsNeYqh-k,It's like paranormal activity and the purge  at the same time
dSBsNeYqh-k,this was a nice short film
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks like a version of Hollow Man.
dSBsNeYqh-k,If an invisible psychopath comes after me I hope I'll have at least a couple black friends.
dSBsNeYqh-k,This definitely won't live up to the original but I guess Universal is more interested in making money then good movies anyway.

dSBsNeYqh-k,Man John Cena keeps getting good roles. Good for him!
dSBsNeYqh-k,Mr India english version
dSBsNeYqh-k,This trailer only spoils it for you if you‚Äôve never seen the Kevin Bacon version.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Yennada jithan movie eduthu vachu irukkinga
dSBsNeYqh-k,"What if she tried to kill him to get his money and that is why he is haunting her. He probably faked his own death, just to get back at her"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Let me get this straight... ""Hollow Man"" gave the character a good reason to become invisible and had him go mad after he turned invisible, part to side effects of the process, part because of the power that comes with being invisible. This movie has an abusive Boyfriend who turns invisible to be a more abusive ex-boyfriend... Sounds like a massive downgrade in storytelling to me..."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Stupid ass using his invisibility to kill.. I would spy on naked ladies being 100% unnoticed creep
dSBsNeYqh-k,Grab some spray paint and spray that fucker in the face. Problem solved.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Elizabeth Moss has become one of my favorite actresses of this generation.  This new take on The Invisible Man looks intriguing and definitely a movie I would like to see.
dSBsNeYqh-k,I think it is similar to a telugu movie called AVUNU
dSBsNeYqh-k,Mast banaya h
dSBsNeYqh-k,WTF?!? This looks more like a horror movie than a reboot of a classic monster movie!!!!
dSBsNeYqh-k,Where's Jack Griffin? The REAL Invisible Man?!?
dSBsNeYqh-k,In the book by H.G.Wells The Invisible Man Griffin is Albino.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Don‚Äôt really care if the movie was spoiled, I still want to see it played out. Looks really good."
dSBsNeYqh-k,What if Universal wants you to think the Invisible man was real only for her to wake up in her prison cell dreaming about how she could've escaped
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Ok thanks for the whole free show, UP. I wasn't even warned so I didn't get any snacks or drinks prepared as I watch this."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Pls released in tamil
dSBsNeYqh-k,is the invisible man actually in the movie? i couldn‚Äôt see him in the trailer. more screen time please.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Okay, I just saw the whole movie through the trailers.
The guy beat his wife, at first it seemed that she was crazy .. but he really managed to be invisible and is wanting revenge on her"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Just like the title, the audience will be also invisible"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Great acting by that invisible guy, so much emotion."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Actually, It is an advanced version of  "" Hollow Man. """
dSBsNeYqh-k,This movie comes out on my birthday!
dSBsNeYqh-k,Did i just watch hollowman again!.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Because the last time Universal remade a classic horror movie went so well...
dSBsNeYqh-k,Oh my God......
dSBsNeYqh-k,"How do you ruin a movie this quickly?

No Thanks."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Johnny Depp was quit from invisible man.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Adrian will haunt her fear. 0:44
It will be crazy! Aren‚Äôt you?!
Okay! He will show you?!
One for you! Ha! (Unlimited)"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Not bad.... but really bad trailer method. Hate it when they over explain plot in the trailer ffs. Just give some exposition, show some cool shots in sync with the music. Not hard, is it?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Why would a rich guy be with her? Wouldn't he be with a Victoria secret model or something.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"finally, a movie staring john cena"
dSBsNeYqh-k,i agree with a lot saying if they didnt show the invisible dude killing people it wouldve been far more interesting to know if shes crazy or not. leaves the viewers guessing all the way to the reveal
dSBsNeYqh-k,HG Wells is spinning in his grave
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow Man + Double Jeopardy
dSBsNeYqh-k,Stop showing the whole movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,"As soon as I read the title of the movie,  i remembered my 12th class's novel *The invisible man*
The central idea is same but the story is different and promising!! üëèüëè"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Jeffrey Epstein didn't kill himself, he's just invisible...."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Thanks for the Cliffsnotes to this movie,  saved me ~2 hours. Great movie tho"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I guess people are upset that a movie called The Invisible Man, based off of a classic book/movie called The Invisible Man, appears to have an invisible man in it?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks like a copied concept of Indian movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks okay not enough for me to watch it at the theaters sorry Universal.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Dracula untold and the Mummy is Faaaaar better they deserve another chance
dSBsNeYqh-k,waiting for this movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,Confusing. No clear plot or plot line.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Gives to much
dSBsNeYqh-k,Interesting. Very very interesting. I‚Äôll watch.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow Man 3?????
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks like a good.
dSBsNeYqh-k,https://youtu.be/jRzjkwI_ZEA
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is nobody talking about how this is like the movie Hollow Man with Kevin Bacon.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"SJW feminists should be happy with this movie,a woman lead and a man that‚Äôs invisible in the movie."
dSBsNeYqh-k,The next hollow man?
dSBsNeYqh-k,And his name is JOHN CENA !!!!
dSBsNeYqh-k,1:08üëçüòÖElizabeth Moss looking gorgeous in this trailer.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Showed way too much in this trailer. Why will I spend money to go see it now? Studios are so dumb man it's mindblowing.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Dark universe we are still here maybe MCU DCEU Monster verse holy hell your alive
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Dude's rich and invented invisibility so he chooses to terrorize his mediocre-looking ex instead of marketing his new invention, becoming world-famous and making trillions of dollars with which he could get pretty much any woman he wanted. Lame."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Elizabeth Moss is cute, but not turn yourself invisible cute. This is crazy. He‚Äôs able to create something that would be worth billions to defense and security contractors around the world and he uses it to stalk his ex wife?!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Must be John Cena..
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Poor H. G. Wells, his wonderful story gets mangled by Hollywood hacks for the umpteenth time. I suppose this will be the ""woke"" version. Zzzzz..."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Just go watch the Invisible Man from 1933 because it's outstanding and so wonderful you will have a great time go see it! X
dSBsNeYqh-k,ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èOnce again you give us everything... Rental. Bring back Tom Cruise and stop with the Amazon Netflix D List actors.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Forget the invisible man check this shit out it's ridiculous and only an original script >https://www.stage32.com/media/2353610449850737327?ref=search&autoplay=1  ...they should make this movie like now, i could see Warner bros even using that same aesthetic they did w/ batman (nolan films) and Joker and applying it to the grim reaper in a more serious and ambitious slasher!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This concept was made long back on Telugu Film Industry by director Ravi Babu named ""Avunu"""
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow man left the group
dSBsNeYqh-k,Why go and see this movie? They've shown 80% of it right here!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"What's with the recent obsession with 'gaslighting'?  I mean, they may as well skip the Invisible Man premise and just remake that movie."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Director RaviBabu's AVUNU Telugu movie remake English version. Nice
dSBsNeYqh-k,Who else got those ‚ÄúHollow man‚Äù vibes? ‚úãüèæ
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I see a lot of people complaining about the fact that the trailer shows that there is indeed an Invisible Man.

 Under most circumstances I would agree, but seeing as how this is supposed to be a reboot of the classic iconic character, and probably another attempt by Universal  to kickstart their Dark Universe,  I think it‚Äôs pretty obvious that‚Äôs the route they‚Äôre taking."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Plot twist : it's a woman
dSBsNeYqh-k,I swear this is a mandela effect for me I saw a poster of this movie at the theater and I remember the poster said Elizabeth Olsen instead of Moss that‚Äôs why I thought she was the protagonist in this movie lmao
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Yikes. Not yikes as in scary, yikes as in stupid. This has absolutely nothing to do with the source material. Read the book. Also, toxic masculinity everybody, that‚Äôs always a great stereotype."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Hey, Universal Pictures. Want to know why your studio is failing? 
1.) See above.
2.) Hire writers who can write and stop remaking Classics. You can not improve on what has been established as Classic.
3.) Stop with the 'empowered' female....of any color.
4.) Stop inserting POC into stories where they never existed."
dSBsNeYqh-k,What would Wells think?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow Man - 2
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks like a Lifetime Original Movie version of the invisible man.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This looks good.... just don't cave to the Twitter outrage mob.... they are not your fans, and they will never see it, even if you do cave.... you all need to earn some money, so give customers what they want.... which is entertainment with no virtue signaling"
dSBsNeYqh-k,??? WHY SHOW US SUCH CRITICAL MOMENTS? I've seen the entire movie at this point.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Spongebob and patrick gave john cena the invisible spray
dSBsNeYqh-k,Sleeping with the enemy meets Hallowman?
dSBsNeYqh-k,I don't need to see it now. There's enough there for me to see.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks good but the trailer gave way too much away. Wont enjoy it as much as i probably would if i hadnt seen it. Shame
dSBsNeYqh-k,So is this supposed to be the same Invisible Man movie that was apart of the Dark Universe before it was scrapped? Kind of luke warm on the trailer honestly.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Aaaaaaand skip it.
dSBsNeYqh-k,She's so ugly I wish it was The Invisible Woman.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This is what they were saying is ""offensive"" to abused victims and mental illnesses? The only thing offensive is that it feels like they showed more. (unless we know she has mental issues.)"
dSBsNeYqh-k,everybody gangster till jah found a way to make himself invisible.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Fucking terrible trailer... at least give us a chance to enjoy the fucking film before showing us everything you dumb hack fucks
dSBsNeYqh-k,He doesn‚Äôt look like that scary after if he was at my house dam I would fight him what ever it coast for my family to survive
dSBsNeYqh-k,Expecting hg wells oh well
dSBsNeYqh-k,Fuck yes universal yes this is EXACTLY what a universal monster movie remake should look like. Remake the other monsters like this please oh my god Frankensteins monster Dracula and the wolf man being this scary? Fuck yes dude oh my god. Of course the 2010 wolf man has a scary wolf man but it wasnt very good but this looks amazing.
dSBsNeYqh-k,A one dollar box of thumbtacks would put an end to his sh*t pretty quickly. =9[.]9=
dSBsNeYqh-k,"A movie about the invisible man, starring a woman, about her ex who turns invisible only to harass and hurt her, as the toxic male he is?

Doesn't go much woker than that."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Saw the whole movie in the trailer.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Thermal optics guys come on
dSBsNeYqh-k,this looks good
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Looks pretty much like ""Hollow Man"", except with the typical leftist gender political slant stating that men suck. Seen it and given it the finger."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This is my second time watching this trailer, and wow does it really suck. While this trailer seemingly gave away the entire movie, this movie's story is nothing like the H.G. Wells novel. Instead of a mad scientist who makes himself invisible and can't find a way back and going even more crazy, we have an abusive boyfriend who turns himself invisible so he can torture his girlfriend. Also if this movie tries to revive the defunct ""Dark Universe"", then I'll be very devastated."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Whole movie in the trailer. Very efficient. Thanks.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Damn John Cena is in the Movie!!!!!
I'm so hyped"
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is so underrated this trailer should get much more views it looks awesome and can‚Äôt wait to watch it.
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks really refreshing compared to all the wokeness going on in hollywood right now.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Movie looks pretty good, just a really shitty trailer"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Invasble man was never a jerk who hurts his girlfriend
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Does anyone remember ""Hollow Man"", the concept resembles that movie"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Her grabbing the knife and wearing gloves shows it all.
She goes crazy from how abusive he is to her, she snaps and kills him and because he was so good at getting into her head, his will to he's death messed with her even more and now she actually is just seeing things and going crazy. That's the twist to the movie."
dSBsNeYqh-k,I was dead set on going to see the movie. Then the trailer decided to show me the whole plot. Now I don‚Äôt need to see the movie. Good job guys
dSBsNeYqh-k,They shouldn't show so much in trailers.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Trailer:
Everyone: OMG THEY SHOWED THE WHOLE MOVIE LOL WE'RE SO ORIGINAL"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Adrian giving Arthur Fleck a run for his money
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Cool trailer and I was definitely interested, but the trailer gave everything away. All the questions I did have were answered halfway into the trailer and now I don't have a reason to go see it in theatre."
dSBsNeYqh-k,The SJW‚Äôs hijacked a classic film....nothing is sacred anymore.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"THIS  LOOKS  BADASS !!!
Twitter puritans can go fuck off."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Man they really had to me too and sjw the movie smh ü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüò£üò£üò£üò£üò£ I wanted them marvel or X-men or or mutant x the movie, not domestic violence the movie smh this a damnnn shame"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"If the movie had stuck with universal and with Johnny Depp as the invisible man, it would‚Äôve been so much better. Johnny Depp is very good at playing bad guys(gellert grindelwald for example) and then the movie would‚Äôve been really horrifying and not this kind of crap"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Lol..this trailer is literally a movie with only good parts..
I just need to watch who survives in the endü§£"
dSBsNeYqh-k,A rip off of the hollow man
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Is it true the SJWs are attacking this because it ""allegedly"" tells people not to believe woman.... That's not the problem here though....The trailer reveals way too much."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Well, it looks good but I think that the trailer spoiled the whole movie. Now I know that she can fight, she can combat him and all of that stuff about him killing cops.


I probably will see it but this spoiled WAY too much."
dSBsNeYqh-k,That's the whole movie.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Finally some potential good movies coming out next year. Hopefully the SJW bullcr*p age is over.
dSBsNeYqh-k,https://youtu.be/1qikcdrZNGA
dSBsNeYqh-k,"The only problem is that they showed the entire plot in one trailer, come on man you had a good thing going."
dSBsNeYqh-k,This movie has convinced me when women claim they were raped the invisible man done it üòÇ #meetoo
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks good
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks like hot garbage fucking come up with original ideas stop rebooting shit you money hungry gremlins
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Everyone: we wouldn't know if he was real or not if it hadn't shown us

Has nobody ever heard of H.G. Wells, one of the most famous English authors who wrote numerous classics which include The Invisible Man where there was a guy who is invisible???"
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks amazing.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I'm so gonna watch it,just to spit in the face of the SJW retards reeeeing at this movie."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Why do some trailers show the entire fucking movie?
dSBsNeYqh-k,I hope there is no rape in this version.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"uh oh, its not all females. they also dont believe her lol. get the fire hoses ready lol"
dSBsNeYqh-k,I've seen the old invisible man but this looks seriously promising.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Spoiler alert: oh wait you don't need one.
dSBsNeYqh-k,the only bad thing about the trailer in my opinion is that we know that he is real.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks okay. I think graying things would have been better. This is more straight up horror when you could go more psyhological with invisibility.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Yahtoo
dSBsNeYqh-k,BELIEVE WAHMEN YOU GUISE!!
dSBsNeYqh-k,I feel like they should have done something better with the invisible man. But I guess it's fine.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Wear puppy armor so he needs to stab the puppies first before hitting you
dSBsNeYqh-k,Invisible man looks transparent girl to do what has never been seen.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Trailer showed too much??? Why would people watch it when they can already guess what goes down from this trailer alone?
dSBsNeYqh-k,looks good.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Wow, this movie going to be a winner in the box office."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"The white guy - The crazy killer and abuser of a poor and pure woman 
The white woman - The victim but enough strong to kick the ass of an invisible man
The black people - The only and nice friends of the white woman
The other white guys - The stupid policeman and another extra to kill 
THIS MOVIE WILL FLOP!!!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow Man.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Oh on......here comes Twitter
dSBsNeYqh-k,John Cena has to be a stunt double. It's just we can't see him.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Although I know what's going to happen, I'll go see it at the theater anyway, because somewhere, an NPC will cry themselves into a hysteria."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Another woke shit movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,will watch 100 %
dSBsNeYqh-k,Don‚Äôt commit adultery ladies.
dSBsNeYqh-k,1:14 BUSTER WOLF
dSBsNeYqh-k,I wish i am able to invisible :D
dSBsNeYqh-k,Wow nice movie.. oh I mean nice trailer...
dSBsNeYqh-k,It looks good.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Why do studios keep releasing trailers that ruin the whole movie? 

How can you consistently be this incompetent without eventually getting replaced by people who can do better?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Did they misspell the title? Why is this called The Invisible Man? This story is literally nothing like the book
dSBsNeYqh-k,Mr. Miyagi: The Invisible....Man?
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is disappointing.   It would be a better story if it was actually all in her head
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow mans brother?
dSBsNeYqh-k,i think it's  a remake of indian telugu  movie ''avunu''
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Good job, idiots. You just ruined the movie with that trailer by giving away 90% of the film, ensuring you will lose millions compared to what you could have made."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Does anyone remeber THE HOLLOW MAN .... u know what i mean !
dSBsNeYqh-k,So...is he running around naked the whole time?
dSBsNeYqh-k,The Human Vapor by Toho was much better.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Hollow man starring Kevin Bacon, ring a bell? This isn't nothing but a reboot with a new name. I saw hollow man over 6 times, brilliant movie."
dSBsNeYqh-k,By watching the trailer  i thought that this movie is the remake (or inspiration) of a telugu film AVUNU
dSBsNeYqh-k,This Movie looks Good Im defnitely going to see this!! üò≥üëåüòäüíñ
dSBsNeYqh-k,Claude rains did it better.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"IM THE INVISIBLE MAN
INCREDIBLE HOW YOU CAN
SEE RIGHT TROUGH ME"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"That's the film ruined, I was thinking of seeing this but there is no point now"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks brilliant!
dSBsNeYqh-k,Sadly his trailer is garbo. Shows too much of the film. I immediately dismissed the film after seeing the trailer which is sad since I justrealized I'm a big fan of the Director and Cinematographer.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Leigh Whannell üî•üî•üî•
dSBsNeYqh-k,"this whole movie is stupid, just cancel"
dSBsNeYqh-k,THE MOST SPOILER TRAILER... LOL
dSBsNeYqh-k,They litterally recaped the whole movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,"February is gonna be an epic month for movies, which I feel like is pretty rare."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Finally a movie about John Cena
dSBsNeYqh-k,"soo, this is different from The Hollow Man... No noo...Its almost the same... Noo..have to see"
dSBsNeYqh-k,glad those cops died to pay the price of being stupid. natural selection
dSBsNeYqh-k,This movie looks like complete and utter crap.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"May be for a first time.. Bollywood already done movie like this in 2004 titled ""GAYAB"""
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks like garbage
dSBsNeYqh-k,Please dont ruin this with cheap jumpsscares
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This movie is probably gonna be good, but this trailer is so bad."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Doesn't look any better than Hollow Man
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow man 3?
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is definitely a Hollow Man reboot
dSBsNeYqh-k,Are they still trying to do the dark universe thing or...üòÇüòÇüòÇ
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Looks appalling, was it edited by a spastic on Caffeine?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,I‚Äôm guessing her black friend dies?...
dSBsNeYqh-k,He's here to set up his reign of terror.
dSBsNeYqh-k,WoW.......Drax reach the next level of invisibility
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I think I'll give this the Mummy treatment, and skip it altogether."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Awesome... very very promising...
conjuring /IT... they never really excited me with their content...
hope the movie delivers"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I‚Äôm the invisible man
I‚Äôm the invisible man 
Incredible how you can
See right through me"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Every mans dream, Being invisible"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"John Cena. 
You can't see me"
dSBsNeYqh-k,this is why i normally avoid trailers.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"*Universal Studios, now this is how you make a horror flick. Make sure to take notes.*"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Do I now really need to watch the movie?
dSBsNeYqh-k,The Translucent backstory?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Claude Rains The Original Universal Invisible Man would be shaking his head!
The trailer gave damn near the entire plot and story away.
Even with BlumHouse I don't foresee this as nothing more than HollowMan minus the gore factor.
Fingers Crossed here's to hoping."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"The Dark Universe to be Continue???
Please..."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Whoever Universal paid to design this trailer should be blacklisted. This isn't a trailer, it's a lazy effort cliff's notes version of the whole movie. He probably got $50K for 2 hrs of lazy ass work."
dSBsNeYqh-k,showed off too much
dSBsNeYqh-k,Blumhouse is doing the things
dSBsNeYqh-k,"""The only thing more brilliant than inventing something that makes you invisible, is coming up with the perfect way to torture you.""


Top tier writing."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks like hallowman
dSBsNeYqh-k,This story line looks like a telugu movie #AVUNU
dSBsNeYqh-k,Isnot this hallowman
dSBsNeYqh-k,This movie looks pretty stupid.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Spongebob did it first
dSBsNeYqh-k,"White alpha male gaslights and beats future #metoo poster child and no one believes her until see makes them see the truth..... Still,  we wonder why women are collectively losing their minds about us. When are we going to rise up against how we are portrayed in shitty stories. Why isn't he mexican or african or asian? Would that be too racist??  Moral to the story: The tech industry is composed of psycho males that are willing to do ANYTHING to achieve the useless goal of hurting innocent people! OK, GOT IT! (and now a word from our sponsor.... Gillette)"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Same kind of movie was seen in Telugu  name of the movie was Avunu printed plot
dSBsNeYqh-k,It's gonna be awesome.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this a movie or a trailer of a movie? ü§î
dSBsNeYqh-k,Gotta feel of the hollowmanüòùüòù
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this from hollow man series??
dSBsNeYqh-k,Really cant make trailers these days. They show the whole fucking thing
dSBsNeYqh-k,They basically showed us the whole movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,Can't wait
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is that Brad pitt The invisible man
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks like Telugu movie AVUNU
dSBsNeYqh-k,I sooo wanna see this
dSBsNeYqh-k,"*JITHAN* remake in english!!....

dSBsNeYqh-k,Wow Blumhouse really going big February!
dSBsNeYqh-k,i searched the queen`s song
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow man again
dSBsNeYqh-k,"When you think about it, you should bee able to see everything that he eats and drinks...Disgusting"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Its a copy of 'AVUNU' movie from telugu language
dSBsNeYqh-k,1:25 this creepy smile had me gulping
dSBsNeYqh-k,"So wait, the clothes he puts on are invisible as well or is he naked ? This is the real scary thing here..."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Nice movie,but too short."
dSBsNeYqh-k,then in the end. he is going to an all-monsters hotel to hide
dSBsNeYqh-k,Keren ini. Harus nonton.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Great. Thanks for showing me the summary to the whole story arc in the trailer. Except for the cliffhanger ending (which is usually the weakest part in horror movies anyways) I guess I've seen all I need now. :P
dSBsNeYqh-k,SPOILER GALORE!!!
dSBsNeYqh-k,It's like hollow man the movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,Wow
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Don't you watch TOM & JERRY
Throw some flour everywhere, you can see his foot prints and even his whole structure
Common sense people"
dSBsNeYqh-k,It's a telugu movie ^avunu^
dSBsNeYqh-k,Shouldn't this be more accurately titled 'An Invisible Man'?
dSBsNeYqh-k,how you gonna kill an invisible man lol
dSBsNeYqh-k,SOLD!
dSBsNeYqh-k,That invisible man is so stupid that he just do killings instead of you know what I mean. üòÅüòÅüòÅ

dSBsNeYqh-k,Telugu lo avunu flim la undi Kada bhai
dSBsNeYqh-k,Translucent is alive!?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This trailer REALLY REALLY hurt the movie, like it had me intrigued but quickly lost interest. I'll just go watch hollow man"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Not original.. copying from kevin bacon movies
dSBsNeYqh-k,I was hoping for 33 with you make
dSBsNeYqh-k,Thought this was going to be a remake of that one movie from back in the day but this is a little different here
dSBsNeYqh-k,The last thing we need... Is for the trailer to show us basically the whole movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,it looks interesting....
dSBsNeYqh-k,Well we just saw the whole movie.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow man gone full psycho again.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Just here to see if it is the movie based on the H.G Wells' book......The Invisible Man
dSBsNeYqh-k,"When I first saw it ,I was like isn't this Hollow Man?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Just spit some fucking blood on the bloke. Thats what Butcher did.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks like a film starting as a thriller with a promising concept until it degrades in the second half into an unimaginative action movie.
dSBsNeYqh-k,U Cant C Me
dSBsNeYqh-k,Damn that was a good movie can‚Äôt wait for the sequel. Like what the fuck fam? They showed the whole movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This is a nice take on the Invisible Man story, showing a victim slowly go insane, instead of focusing on the titular Invisible Man go insane (he‚Äôs already nuts, so it seems)! But it was kind of spoiler-y to see police getting attacked by what can possibly only be said Invisible Man (takes away the mystery of if it‚Äôs actually someone who‚Äôs invisible, or just her going absolutely crazy and attacking cops herself out of pure paranoia and fear). Overall looks promising, though! Loved the original Universal Monster film, loved Kevin Bacon as the Hollow Man. Hopefully I‚Äôll add this film to my favorites of the Invisible Man story adaptations."
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks like trash xd
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This movie is already in Telugu language as ""Avunu"""
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Trailer should've ended at about 1:35, you showed to much."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Why show if the guy is invisible ?
dSBsNeYqh-k,No.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Oohh...imagine that, an unindividuated greedy woman, with no agency, racked with guilt and blame, being 'attacked' by her invisible whitemale ex...can't be bothered to go and see the movie, it looks anti-white."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"is this about the invisible 'patriarchy' oppressing women, even when white men aren't there? seems like it."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I mean, her father was Invisible Man, although Batman stopped him... But still!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"HOLLOW MAN JUST CALLED, HE WANTS HIS FAGGOT ASS FILM BACK"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Ok no need to watch this movie trailer showed it all lol
dSBsNeYqh-k,Blumhouse is the best
dSBsNeYqh-k,""" This movie will be invisible at the theatre"""
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Elisabeth Shue  : Hollow Man
Elisabeth Moss : Invisible Man"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks like shit. HG Wells is turning in his grave .
dSBsNeYqh-k,bucket of paint - the end
dSBsNeYqh-k,"so many movies now with a concept of ""it is more scary if you do not see the thing"" lol"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Ma #ravibabu elantie movie epudo chesesaru
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Made some popcorn, sat and watched the trailer - sweet !   Looks like a great movie !   Saved money too !"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"When Universal loses billions trying to create a ""Dark Universe,"" just sub-contract the copyrights Blumhouse."
dSBsNeYqh-k,So heat-vision goggles don't exist?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Fun fact: If he were really invisible, he would also be completely blind b/c light can't refract in his eyeballs."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"If you want something good with the invisible Man plot, you should read the Herbert George Wells novel. It's really good, I love it."
dSBsNeYqh-k,my volune was on max cuz im a maniac and got scared af when he was banging on that car window
dSBsNeYqh-k,This movie like 'Aatma Ka Ghar ' south India movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,So a sequel to Hollow man? I love Kevin Bacon.
dSBsNeYqh-k,woooow! thanks for saving me money and time... I saw the whole movie already!
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is the peak of cinema.
dSBsNeYqh-k,I always thought that the invisible man (from the books) should have Kevin Conroys Batman voice
dSBsNeYqh-k,It copy of imran hasmi's  MR X ü§£ü§£ü§£
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this part of that Dark Universe deal?
dSBsNeYqh-k,*Universal is like :  let`s make a movie that already exists but 10 times worse!*
dSBsNeYqh-k,Thank you for showing me the whole movie. Less 1 ticket! ;)
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Trailers dont say shit about films, trailers are just all bad, that said this movie will probably suck."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Oh well since you can see the invisible man is killing the cop in the trailer now we know she isn't crazy or hallucinating. Basically they just ruined the whole plot.
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks hella good
dSBsNeYqh-k,I just watched the whole movie it was a 2 min trailer
dSBsNeYqh-k,BUNCH A RAAAAAATS
dSBsNeYqh-k,Green Screen intensifies *
dSBsNeYqh-k,Drax va a hacer el hombre invisible
dSBsNeYqh-k,What are the things you would do if you were invisible?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Great ... I hate it when trailers show to much
dSBsNeYqh-k,Another movie whit a feminist plot next time Dr√°cula and the Werewolf we're rapist and van Helsing we're be a Brave woman ready yo stop this male mounsters
dSBsNeYqh-k,They showed the WHOLE movie. Why do trailers do this nowadays. Could've stopped after the flame got higher.. smh
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Remake of Hollow Man, come on Hollywood!!!!!!!!! Be more original!!!!!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,It looks like a remake of movie name calling AVUNU a south Indian Telugu film
dSBsNeYqh-k,Amazing thriller........ Hope movie must be more better than trailer
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks cool but i fear the ending will be stupid
dSBsNeYqh-k,What‚Äôs the age rating anyone?
dSBsNeYqh-k,trailer gave the whole thing away
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Critics are saying that this is better than  JOKER. Please, u guys are idiots"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I watched a the same movie before, the invisible man but the story isn't the same of course. Something they experiment a man to become an invisible but they can't turn him back. So the that invisible man used it to kill some of the scientists."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Meh, I'm gonna play Death Stranding instead"
dSBsNeYqh-k,I wish Sanji has this ability. In a good way
dSBsNeYqh-k,Predecible
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow man was better
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks pretty lame
dSBsNeYqh-k,I dont like it. The invisible man is not a slasher/drama/thriller.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is it a marketing strategy to give up the story of the movie through trailers?
dSBsNeYqh-k,I immediately thought that the boyband 98degrees was getting a movie for their song Invisible Man... lol!
dSBsNeYqh-k,This movie is no competition to the Joker like an article said. It's like paranormal activity but it's a human thats invisible not a demon.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"your lil sunshine adrien grow up and see what has he become when ladybug and hawkmoth betrayed him..

nope. lets fix  and reset that..
*miraculous ladybug!*"
dSBsNeYqh-k,So is the Monster Cinematic Universe still in play? We got Wolfman. The Mummy. Now this?
dSBsNeYqh-k,The trailer was a terrible idea. The name of the movie too. Why not keeping it secret that he is invisible after whatever happend? What a dumb decision ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
dSBsNeYqh-k,"So instead of being a warning against incorrect science misconducts, it‚Äôs about a guy who was too obsessive in his relationship..... wohooo"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Saw an article saying this was more disturbing than the joker, nah chief this ain‚Äôt it"
dSBsNeYqh-k,The movie name already make me finish the movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,"The trailer looks like it spoils pretty much everything. But there's a certain name that makes me raise an eyebrow: Leigh Whannell is directing and writing this. The same dude behind Saw, Upgrade, and at least one Insidious movie. The same dude with a pension for twist endings that change the entire movie. Maybe the trailer is INTENDED to look like a typical stalker movie, and there's something Leigh Whannell has up his sleeve that we don't know yet. I may go see this movie. If I turn out to be wrong, then I will admit the movie was spoiled by the trailer and everyone saying so was right. But I will give this a chance, if only because of Whannell."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Kinda spoiled a whole lot
dSBsNeYqh-k,So basically Hollow Man!! Rather watch that movie! Marco! Polo!
dSBsNeYqh-k,The invisible guy is John Cena
dSBsNeYqh-k,"It's not based on the novel or the 1933 Film, so why are you referencing H.G. Wells and using the title when you clearly don't understand either? You could have named it something else, focused on the question of the lead character's sanity, and had a decent thriller. You already botched Dracula and The Mummy. After this movie are you aiming for a golden sombrero by turning Dr. Frankenstein's modern Prometheus into a self-conscious emo being teased about his neck bolts?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Damn looks good!!!
dSBsNeYqh-k,It was like a normal movie!!! Not that bad but some creepy............
dSBsNeYqh-k,"So is this in the DUCU?

IS THE DUCU BACK?!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,TOOOOOSHHH
dSBsNeYqh-k,ohh boy bravo!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Good movie, will prob watch it again with friends tmmr during our 10 min break."
dSBsNeYqh-k,üëçüèø
dSBsNeYqh-k,Seems promising as it's the other US girl a brilliant actor she's
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I just saw an article about how this movie and i quite ‚Äúis more toxic than Joker‚Äù 
So i‚Äômma watch this just for that"
dSBsNeYqh-k,i remember Kevin Bacon Hollow Man Movie in 2000.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow Man Hollow Man Hollow Man
dSBsNeYqh-k,Really hope this movie will save the DARK UNIVERSE.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I hope this is not just another cheap ‚Äúit was all in her head, she‚Äôs crazy‚Äù situation."
dSBsNeYqh-k,mind as well show the whole film lmao
dSBsNeYqh-k,something different..
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Well, guess I don't need to see the movie now...I just saw it."
dSBsNeYqh-k,when they purposly put the plot twist in the title and trailer....
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Whoever made this movie clearly has zero understanding of the property.  Its not just about an evil man who is invisible, its supposed to be about how the power corrupts a good man, how not having to see his reflection allows a good man to do horrible things.


This is just a shitty evil boyfriend movie and the invisible factor adds nothing to it."
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks good!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Lemme guess, she's having a ""Fight Club"" moment"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks pretty good but i still wish they'd do a Dr. Jekal and Mr Hyde movie about Russel crowe's version of him from the mummy
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is it me or everyone thinks it is hollow man returns??
dSBsNeYqh-k,"TERRIBLE TRAILER, WHY SHOW THAT MUCH OF THE FILM.  
A SHORT SIMPLE EDIT ""COULD"" HAVE GAINED YOURSELF A BIGGER AUDIENCE, BAFFLES ME HOW THIS TRAILER WAS APPROVED."
dSBsNeYqh-k,The older one with Kevin bacon was way better.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Exactly look like copied from Indian Tolly wood Super hit Movie AVUNU...Directed by Ravi Babu... if i  wrong pls watch the trailer of Avunu movie part 1. Or watch the full movie Avunu
dSBsNeYqh-k,Horrid
dSBsNeYqh-k,"""Yesterday, upon the stair,
I met a man who wasn't there!
He wasn't there again today,
Oh how I wish he'd go away!""

When I came home last night at three,
The man was waiting there for me
But when I looked around the hall,
I couldn't see him there at all!
Go away, go away, don't you come back any more!
Go away, go away, and please don't slam the door...

Last night I saw upon the stair,
A little man who wasn't there,
He wasn't there again today
Oh, how I wish he'd go away..."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Am I supposed to believe that Kate Moss is the girl that drives this guy to be so obsessive?....
dSBsNeYqh-k,She should just bring a pack of flours
dSBsNeYqh-k,It's similar like Hollow man
dSBsNeYqh-k,Ok Blumhouse did better that trailer than that fantasy island trailer with stupid song Ariana Grande - 7 rings doesn't make a horrifying trailer.
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is a copy of Telugu movie Avunu
dSBsNeYqh-k,KEVIN BACON SAID REMEMBER ITS STILL HIS PROJECT
dSBsNeYqh-k,"No thanks, looks like shit. I'll just watch Hollow Man again."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Dubbed in hindi
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow Man 3 looks great xD
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Well, no need to go to the movie theater now."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Look like Hollow Man
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this hollow man reboot?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Seen the trailer. Seen the movie. Thanks Universal for helping me save a few buck$ and a trip to the movies.  üòÄüëç
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This movie comes out almost exactly 80 years after ""The Invisible Man Returns"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollywood f*** another masterpiece... Don't use titles from books that we treasure!
dSBsNeYqh-k,Avunu part-3
dSBsNeYqh-k,The movie concept resembles like Avunu telugu movie

dSBsNeYqh-k,Why do love the sociopath
dSBsNeYqh-k,Yeap... i just watched the movie in full
dSBsNeYqh-k,Not looking good for me i dont know i just dont like the trailer and invisible man is not a character in tihis like in the original he is just a mute monster and i dont like this so far
dSBsNeYqh-k,"There are 2 posible ways: 
He is actually real and invisible and she wasn't crazy after all

dSBsNeYqh-k,Cant top Kevin Bacon's Hollow Man üí™üí™
dSBsNeYqh-k,Thanks for saving my ticket money
dSBsNeYqh-k,My biggest gripe is they made him a psychotic asshole from the beginning and part of what made the original story so compelling was the process of a good man being driven insane by the power and inconveniences that come with being invisible. Hes supposed to be a tragic  character not just an out and out monster. They completely missed the mark to give the brainlet masses another shitty jumpscare fest. And the only thing this had going for it was it looked like it was going to toy with the notion that it was all in her head but we clearly see him attacking people.
dSBsNeYqh-k,(2000) Hollow Man's remake ???

dSBsNeYqh-k,Saw this trailer and man all I can say is Kevin Bacon did this already  back in 2000 SMH... #hollowman
dSBsNeYqh-k,Trash
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Meh. This looks the sort of 40-minute story you'd see in a procedural show on TV like Fringe or The Flash. Doesn't feel like something that could fill a 2-hour movie. Plus, it feels exactly like the sort of thing we've already seen and they've already given us all the major plot beats:

- Unstable man wants revenge on woman.
- Man fakes death and gives her an inheritance.
- The inheritance is conditioned on her being declared mentally stable.
- Man turns invisible and uses his power to make her think she's insane.
- Everyone believes she's crazy because she's an idiot that doesn't carry around a spray paint can to use on the guy when she suspects he's there.
- Invisible man makes a mistake and gives himself away or she finally gets clever and proves he's real.
- Now everyone's on the run from an invisible man, something that's really not that much of a threat in today's world once you know he's real (again, spray paint cans or just a flour bag should do the trick).
- I'm gonna go out on a limb and declare that the good guys win. Bonus points if there's a stinger that suggests the invisible guy is still around after everyone thought he died.


This is a goddamn Scooby Doo episode."
dSBsNeYqh-k,The trailer gets epic at 1:24
dSBsNeYqh-k,"The trailer absolutely ruined the whole movie, even if I go to watch it I already basically know what‚Äôs going to happen for a large part of the movie"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Nice to see John Cena is finally getting a solo movie!
dSBsNeYqh-k,This movie is gonna suck!

dSBsNeYqh-k,Wow that was a pretty good movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I was decently surprised when I saw this. I had no idea they were still on board with this. Plus, I really enjoy Elizabeth Moss."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Sometimes,  we should all stop watching film trailers to get the feeling being spoiled of watching whole movie compressed in one trailer"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Just throw paint on him duhhhh
dSBsNeYqh-k,Reminds me of Hollow Man with Kevin Bacon
dSBsNeYqh-k,The classic movie is still gold imo
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Wait, is this an MCU movie? Why is Drax in it?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Can't wait for the Kevin Bacon cameo.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I‚Äôm sorry, but this movie looks bad. When I heard about this, I REALLY wanted to like it. I really did. But this movie doesn‚Äôt feel like a remake of the original. The original was about a doctor who found a potion that turns him invisible. Seems cool and even wacky. A FAR cry from this. This seems to be about an abusive boyfriend (which is starting to become horror cliche) who is revived and turned invisible. This seems like the plot for one of those dumbass horror text message stories. Also, this trailer showed more than it needed to. I practically watched the whole movie just now. Here‚Äôs the plot. An abusive boyfriend dies and leaves the girlfriend relieved. However, he comes back and is invisible. She tries to tell everyone and people start thinking she‚Äôs going insane. She then finds out his secret, kills him for good, and gets her revenge. There you go. Don‚Äôt need to watch the movie now. Also the acting. I hated 1:26. That seems like the acting skills a high school freshman has when they didn‚Äôt do their homework. And then there‚Äôs 1:23. This is practically all Blumhouse movies in a nutshell. The actors being unnecessarily creepy when nothing scary is going on. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre implying that what they‚Äôre saying isn‚Äôt creepy. Which at first IS creepy. But the more they imply that they‚Äôre not being creepy leads you to believe that what they‚Äôre saying isn‚Äôt creepy. Also, this just seems like another ‚Äúall men bad‚Äù kind of story. You can tell because it went from ‚Äúwacky doctor turns invisible‚Äù to ‚Äúabusive boyfriend dies and then haunts his girlfriend‚Äù. All I‚Äôm saying is that I don‚Äôt think this movie is going to be good. Like all other Blumhouse movies before it, it‚Äôs trying too hard to be scary. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm especially worried about what they‚Äôre going to do with FNaF and Fantasy Island."
dSBsNeYqh-k,So another hollow man

dSBsNeYqh-k,I swear it feels like it was joked that an Invisible Man movie would be made.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow man...
dSBsNeYqh-k,The Invisible Man - Official Trailer [[[[[[[[[[[HD]]]]]]]]]]]] what are you guys from 2010??!
dSBsNeYqh-k,Now that looks like it‚Äôs going to be good!
dSBsNeYqh-k,Well Well Well. If it ain't an invisible cunt.
dSBsNeYqh-k,It‚Äôs basically a modern version of Hollow Man?
dSBsNeYqh-k,ANGEL OF DEATH ARISE
dSBsNeYqh-k,That's right fake-Jew babies....... JESUS SEES YOU........
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I got bored half way. Just another slasher, cheap thrills movie and nothing intelligent"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Whoever is responsible for making the trailer needs to be fired. It‚Äôs stupid to get a grasp of the entire plot within a trailer. They could‚Äôve easily made it seem like a haunted house movie with suspicion of an invisible guy.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"GEE, how can we needlessly make a WOMAN the LEAD in an invisible MAN movie?? So stupid."
dSBsNeYqh-k,is this part of the MCU?? because I had no idea Drax was in it üò±üò±
dSBsNeYqh-k,"When they released it

*John Cena felt that...*"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"if the trailer had shown less, more people would have watched, going into the film eager to find out whether the man is actually invisible, or if the woman is just batshit crazy. Thanks to the trailer, we now know there actually IS an invisible Man (may or may not be her ex),  that the woman was right all along, and that she'll most likely find her strength, stand up to her invisible ex, and in all likelihood, be the one to kill him in the film's finale. Thanks trailer."
dSBsNeYqh-k,This trailer was so good... that i decided to wait for it to go to dvd. Really?? We saw evrything that our imagination was supposed to wonder about. Nice.
dSBsNeYqh-k,It must would be up side down
dSBsNeYqh-k,"""Well well well, if it ain't the invisible cunt."" - Butcher"
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks like more Hollywood man hate.  A guy finds a way to turn invisible and he waste it on tormenting his ex.
dSBsNeYqh-k,I guess Drax wasn't joking about his ability.
dSBsNeYqh-k,I think it's awesome that they used John Cena as a double for when the dude's invisible
dSBsNeYqh-k,Keeping my fingers crossed for the monster universe tie ins the film looks promising by itself for sure
dSBsNeYqh-k,Interesting
dSBsNeYqh-k,Not as good as Hollow Man
dSBsNeYqh-k,This movie reminds me of Hollow Man. I can't wait to watch this üëçüòé
dSBsNeYqh-k,Just call Daredevil...
dSBsNeYqh-k,Invisible man reboot?
dSBsNeYqh-k,they could get a more attractive girl to be the main character i think
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Perhaps this should be called ""AN Invisible Man"" not ""THE Invisible Man""? You guys might confuse people who actually read books."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Sometimes a preview shows too much. If it left it with ‚Äúis she crazy‚Äù it may have been interesting to watch, but showing she appears crazy but we get to see him doing these things to drive her crazy just gave the whole movie away!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,The Invisible Man - Official Movie [HD]
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This just feels like a ""movie"".  Why do I want to give my time to watch this?  If it has the ""moniker"" of ""The Invisible Man"", shouldn't I be excited to see the movie?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Ephemeral rift should be in this movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Most of these new horror movies were shit in 2019, I watched lots of them"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Oh wow so creepy üò±
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow Man sequel?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"That's weird , usually they release a trailer before the film."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Only a coward would make himself invisible
dSBsNeYqh-k,Reminds me of hollow man Lol ü§®üòâ
dSBsNeYqh-k,looks great..........
dSBsNeYqh-k,We have similar concept movies in Bollywood with name 'Mr. X' and 'Gaayab'
dSBsNeYqh-k,So... have you seen the movie Hallow Man?... just saying ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Shame. Looks cool, but the lowered the Invisible Man to a I'm going to stalk my ex guy. What the bug women at bars guy role taken by Dracula?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Anyone wanna bet that Cecilia is actually STEM controlling her?
dSBsNeYqh-k,The only thing that this trailer don't show is the ending üòÖ well still gonna watch it if it come to Netflix
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Well, the full version would of been better....too bad. C+"
dSBsNeYqh-k,What happen to the trailer nowadays??
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks like Avunu A Telugu film which is directed by Ravi Babu....
dSBsNeYqh-k,"People in the comment section are idiots, there are such thing as twists right?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"All visible trailer for 
The invisible man ."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Remake of Avunu Telugu movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,It Reminds tollywood movie named 'AVUNU'
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Most of the ""RAVI BABU"" s telugu language films are on this concept of 'invisible'.
So many movies we watched already."
dSBsNeYqh-k,You saw?  I'm not here..
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Exactly how NOT to do a trailer ... it usually follows that if you can watch the entire movie in a 2-second trailer, the movie is NOT worth going to see."
dSBsNeYqh-k,It looks promising but oh boy they showed too muchüòÇ
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Hey wait a minute, Elizabeth Moss supports Scientology which would do this whole plot line."
dSBsNeYqh-k,1:25 sis are you okay
dSBsNeYqh-k,Dark universe??
dSBsNeYqh-k,This showed us way too much of the movie.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Wait, I thought this universe was cancelled"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Thanks for showing the whole movie universal, no need to go see it now!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,1:27 How to prove to people you‚Äôre not insane...give them Jack Nicholson eyes. Brilliant strategy üëèüëèüëè
dSBsNeYqh-k,It‚Äôs probably her all along and she‚Äôs the crazy one.
dSBsNeYqh-k,class 12 ke londo yeh woh wala invisible man nai hai
dSBsNeYqh-k,"So what is this a ghost story?
YAWWWWWWN"
dSBsNeYqh-k,So is Scatman John gonna make a cameo or what?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Insert joke about the invisible man and the year 2020
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Why would you cram the whole movie in two minutes? I saw all I needed to see. It looks like an interesting psychological spin on the Invisible Man concept, and you ruined any mystery it had"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Nice
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollowman 2019
dSBsNeYqh-k,Anyone watched Hollow Man? Seems like a bit of a copie????
dSBsNeYqh-k,That was a nice movie. When is the trailer releasing?
dSBsNeYqh-k,This show is pure chaos
dSBsNeYqh-k,Paranormal Ass-Whooping: The Movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,I'm getting the Boys vibe
dSBsNeYqh-k,C'est bon on a vu tout le film
dSBsNeYqh-k,I wonder why they never called it the hollow man?
dSBsNeYqh-k,It's basically like hollow man just the 2019 version
dSBsNeYqh-k,ELISABETH MOSS IS A GEM. I LOVED HER IN ‚ÄòTHE KITCHEN‚Äô.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Let's hope they don't have another Hollow man scene with Rhona Mitra. SMH!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Damn. It has Elizabeth Moss.

Can't support Scientology. Sorry."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Dang it why? I doubt this is dark universe
dSBsNeYqh-k,so that whole monster universe didnt work out. (even though it had potential) maybe they should let them be horrors.  havent had a monster horror movie in awhile
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks like a great movie but the trailer shows too much. I'm sure that part of this is from the last 30 minutes of the film. I hate the shit out of that. Stop doing that! If you can't sell a picture at around a minute or under and you have to show the whole thing you have no faith in it and people can tell that. Cutting a trailer use to be an art. A tease. As important as the film itself.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Sooooo this film looks OK I guess. It doesn‚Äôt really look like anything but a ghost haunting horror film or something.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks interesting but they showed the whole movie in the trailer
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Reminded me a bit to Son of the Invisible Man.

Even seen a shirt make a phone call?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Just saw the whole movie from watching this trailer I think. No need to rent it now I guess.
dSBsNeYqh-k,One ugly ass white girl she should be invisibleüòÇ
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Looks good, but just like many other trailers the past few years, it basically just recapped the entire film :/"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow man sequel...
dSBsNeYqh-k,"All she needs to do is get an infrared camera and prove to everyone he ain't dead, problem solved."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Remake of the  movie Hollow Man
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This is aweful.
Universal was supposed to have a marvel typr run with all the moster universe charactors.
This originally was supposed to be johnny depp.
Tom cruise mummy franchise wasnt supposed to flop.
This was next then wolf man then frankenstein monster. Now they are making a lower budget type movie. So the expectation is not very high for this one."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hell yeah first time am hype about a trailer in 2 years.
dSBsNeYqh-k,The invisible Man & The hollow Man look like same but few scenes only different ü§™ü§™ü§™ü§™ü§™
dSBsNeYqh-k,Why the f this is horror
dSBsNeYqh-k,Why Hollywood have no original idea left anymore. We have seen the Hollow  Man and it was amazing.
dSBsNeYqh-k,please release in tamil
dSBsNeYqh-k,I think it's look like Telugu movie *AVUNU *  same story.Same to same.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Would like to watch this but I dont think I can do 2hrs of the handmaid's tail lady. I dont like looking at her. Now give it the ol fliperroo to where it's the invisible woman and it's her then definitely.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Everyone is visible aahh where is in visible manü§î
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Hey, that's my movie name"
dSBsNeYqh-k,maybe this should be the start of another attempt at the dark universe...
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks awesomely bad
dSBsNeYqh-k,Sooooo are off brand version of Hallow Man??
dSBsNeYqh-k,well well well.... if aint the
dSBsNeYqh-k,The origin story of Tanslucent from the Boys.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"u should have made this trailer more invisible
because clearly i can see the whole plot"
dSBsNeYqh-k,There you are...Showed the whole movie in the trailer... Again!!!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Iam already watching this movie in ""telugu"" language telugu is of the indian language.  Movie name is ""Avunu"""
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Damn,Hill House has messed my boy Luke  pretty bad üò£"
dSBsNeYqh-k,They just gave away the whole movie.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Watch hollow man . It like this movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Welp basically watched the movie,. 10/10 IGN"
dSBsNeYqh-k,I thought it is based on the novel 'the invisible man' after seeing the title üòÖüòÖ
dSBsNeYqh-k,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZyen1ZZxKxtMGyfePw2OsQ - SubscribeüîÆ
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks like a load of shite
dSBsNeYqh-k,Do u know how to do a trailer? or u just playing idiot showing pretty much the entire film in less than 3 min?
dSBsNeYqh-k,I rather watch Hollow Man
dSBsNeYqh-k,Did Nobody Else Think About Batman The Animated Series ‚ÄúSee No Evil‚Äù Or Am I Just Trippin..
dSBsNeYqh-k,what date this film release
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hmm...Leigh Wannell (wrote Saw) and Elizabeth Moss (good actor)...could be good. Although I definitely doubt Leigh's directing capabilities.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Well I it ain't the invisible c**t
dSBsNeYqh-k,Spoiler Alert: It was Kevin Bacon all along.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Just like the hollow man movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,Didn't we watch this movie 15 years ago with Kevin Bacon?
dSBsNeYqh-k,As same as the story from the book of H G Wells.....
dSBsNeYqh-k,Thought this was the movie with Johnny Depp. I was mistaken...
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Wish the Very Best of Trailer doesn't spoil too much.
Keep the horror and suspense intact."
dSBsNeYqh-k,The modified hollow man
dSBsNeYqh-k,How has no one noticed the hollow man comparison
dSBsNeYqh-k,Another terrible invisible man movie.  No one will ever get it right.. just stop making crap
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Hollow man, new version i think"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Plot twist...




HIS NAME IS JOHN CENA!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Wack
dSBsNeYqh-k,I‚Äôd rather see a guy with only a shirt on flailing his arms around as he chases people
dSBsNeYqh-k,"thanks for summarising the whole movie in a trailer,  I will not bother"
dSBsNeYqh-k,I upload similar content on my channel
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Definitely not something I would want to see.  It looks a lot different from the story book, especially when they will have a crazy woman be the main protagonist and not the invisible man."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"You know I really wish the trailer left it ambitious, whether or not this was all in her head or not. But screw sublty am I right."
dSBsNeYqh-k,What about Johnny depp :/
dSBsNeYqh-k,"MEH, KEVIN BACON MOVIE WAS BETTER"
dSBsNeYqh-k,I bet he‚Äôs John Cena
dSBsNeYqh-k,Mr India is that you?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"When someone gets invisible he wont apend Time on a stupid woman like her.. Theres a lot of things other than this.
Stupid movie"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Fuck that in an interview of the mummy Tom cruise said that jhonny depp is going to play invincible man.......
dSBsNeYqh-k,Another trailer spoiling the movie lol didn‚Äôt look that good anyway
dSBsNeYqh-k,This movie concept already came in tamil cinima .. Movie name *jithan * credits goes to Tamil movie Jithan director only ..
dSBsNeYqh-k,All the women in this film are ugly.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Thanks for showing the big plot twists Universal! Not paying to see this in theaters now. Money saved!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This movie is like a ""Hollow man"" movie"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Plot Twist: It's John Cena!
dSBsNeYqh-k,Well I don‚Äôt even need to see the movie now. You‚Äôve given away every possible twist and turn and piece of plot. That was very stupid. I 100% guarantee this movie won‚Äôt even make its budget back. You are very stupid for doing this. But Hollywood and stupidity are synonyms now so....
dSBsNeYqh-k,"well, well, well......if it ain't the invisible cunt"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Probably a good $1.98 Netflix date night. Not to be seen at the movies for $12
dSBsNeYqh-k,It is concept from a Telugu movie (avunu).
dSBsNeYqh-k,too much spoiler.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"That was so interesting and cool, I came here with so low expectations! and what they do? they reveal the whole movie in the trailer!!!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Awesome
dSBsNeYqh-k,Remember when Spongebob trying to get into the club of strong man and Patrick get kick in  his butt? this is the man behind all of that
dSBsNeYqh-k,"WOW! This movie is crazy and scary, but I can't wait to see it."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"So a guy who has millions, if not billions, decides to fake his death just to mentally torture an ex he is obsessed with.
Rather than, you know, using his wealth to completely ruin her life using the law, or hiring someone to stalk and torture her, or bribing people to ruin her."
dSBsNeYqh-k,This trailer is looking like AVUNU movie from India... Tollywood
dSBsNeYqh-k,You sack so much you bich
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is where you beat yourself up!
dSBsNeYqh-k,More like a ghost story
dSBsNeYqh-k,I'm the invisible man.Cant you tellüòé
dSBsNeYqh-k,Thanks for ruining the whole movie by showing the whole fucking plot.
dSBsNeYqh-k,You don‚Äôt need 2 freaking minutes to give a promising trailer to a promising movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,They better have The Invisible Man‚Äôs classic clothes or else we‚Äôre all gonna riot....
dSBsNeYqh-k,The Trailer just revealed details that would have been a twist to see it
dSBsNeYqh-k,What happened to Johnny Depp playing the Invisible Man?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"If he doesn't were his classic bandeges and oufit to be visible, i will be mad"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Invisibility has always been a prefered power for creeps
dSBsNeYqh-k,Inspired from jiththan movie from Tamil
dSBsNeYqh-k,Thanks! Can't wait for the trailer.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"have you seen ""Avunu"" Indian movie ?? look like ""The Invisible Man"" ....haha

See right through you
I'm in your room

So make my mark from the edge of the world
From the edge of the world
From the edge of the world

Look at me, look at me
Shake me, shake me, shake me dear"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Universal Pictures, here's a tip for you and other studios, stop showing the whole movie in your trailers. Who is going to go spend $8+ on a ticket for your movie if we see damn near everything about the plot. Had you stayed with the paranoia angle it would have been suspenseful, yet you lay out everything that happens and now we don't need to see your movie. Have you forgotten that a trailer is to tease and entice the public to see a movie?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Plot twist: The Invisible man's true target is the director of the film because it might be a failure.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"again, they revealed too much"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Great, they involved the whole movie into a trailer, no need to see this now."
dSBsNeYqh-k,SPOILER...Black guy dies...  lol
dSBsNeYqh-k,Like the hollow man?
dSBsNeYqh-k,No thanks. I liked the original. But best of luck.
dSBsNeYqh-k,If this is good u can reboot the monster series
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Me: ""Hey, looks interesting. A sociopathic, stalker ghost.""

Movie: ""Nah bruh, dude is literally invisible.""

Me: ""God damn it."""
dSBsNeYqh-k,This flim look like Indian movie 'AVUNU' copy
dSBsNeYqh-k,Literally just showed us the whole movie ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
dSBsNeYqh-k,"If I could be invisible, I ain't haunting no bitch !
The premise of this movie is stupid !"
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is Telugu move avunu
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks good.
dSBsNeYqh-k,#MonsterVerse?
dSBsNeYqh-k,I wonder if he fucked her invisibly
dSBsNeYqh-k,You thought you could just remake hollow man from 2000 and we wouldnt notice?
dSBsNeYqh-k,I hope it's better than the mummy
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Thank you for showing the whole movie dumbass!

Even scenes from the end in trailer .."
dSBsNeYqh-k,The dark universe has become invisible
dSBsNeYqh-k,is this the sequel of Hollow Man?
dSBsNeYqh-k,FLOP 2020. Smh.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Avunu........
dSBsNeYqh-k,The universal monsters deserve better than this garbage üóë I fear the classic monsters will never get the revival they deserve üò™
dSBsNeYqh-k,"What Editers making yall trailers?? Fire them, they be leaking the whole movie, wish i wouldve clicked off this half way in, i cant even fein to watch it because i just did"
dSBsNeYqh-k,The hollow?
dSBsNeYqh-k,reminds me of hollow man.
dSBsNeYqh-k,https://youtu.be/zKdxd718WXg remmonded everyone!
dSBsNeYqh-k,New Predator movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,üòè real life
dSBsNeYqh-k,If I had invisibility there's no way in hell  I'd be caught
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow man joins the room
dSBsNeYqh-k,People saying they just saw the whole movie. You know that they also use scenes that they don't use in the movie itself.
dSBsNeYqh-k,I feel excited and disappointed at the same time wanted a movie which is atmospheric horror about the invisible man in a old town of 19th century killing people but excited that they have a new idea and not just copying the novel or the 1933 movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,Thank u for showing the whole movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Hollow Man vibes, very cool"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"The twist is, the girl has multiple personalities. She did all the things that she thought the invincible man did."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Thanks to ""Hollow Man"""
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Whoever made this trailer, should be fired... this feels like a short film"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Brilliant one
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Why she saying where are you in the rain, how you not see a whole shape?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Is this OFFCIAL REMAKE OF *AVUNU* MOVIE ?
Can anybody tell me
https://youtu.be/KIFJNawbIFQ
Both movies have same plotüòÖ"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Life is busy... Watch a whole movie in the time a trailer!! Modern Problems Requires Modern Solutions
dSBsNeYqh-k,Pathetic
dSBsNeYqh-k,I remember reading somewhere that Johnny Depp was supposed to be in the movie as The Invisible Man or someone else. But honestly I don't see Johnny Depp playing The Invisible Man.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"A film was made with this invisibility concept 7 years back in Telugu, named Avunu. Many shots reminded me of that movie."
dSBsNeYqh-k,This movie just looks like Telugu movie 'Avunu'
dSBsNeYqh-k,Giving away waaaaaaay too much. Come on now. Shit trailer
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Y'all just keep giving the DAMN MOVIE AWAY, WHY"
dSBsNeYqh-k,A darker side of the Invisible Man!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Hey guys take a minute and take out the short film me and my friends made titled ‚Äúcandy corn‚Äù. It‚Äôs much appreciated. Thanks. 
https://youtu.be/GCcCoQcKm6w"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"you did really well to show the whole movie in this trailer, well done....."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow Man 3
dSBsNeYqh-k,Kevin Bacon! Is that you?
dSBsNeYqh-k,It's look like telugu avunu movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,**Carries a can of gasoline and matches at all times** GG
dSBsNeYqh-k,Well thanks for showing the entire movie. No need to see it now. Thanks again! AssholesüôÑ
dSBsNeYqh-k,This movie is looks closely like our Telugu movie AVUNU directed by RAVIBABU as it is like that
dSBsNeYqh-k,Sooo basically a newer more personal version of Hollow Man? Okay....I‚Äôll be right back I‚Äôm getting kevin on y‚Äôall!!!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"You know, if he is actually invisible,  a pair of thermal goggles takes away his entire edge."
dSBsNeYqh-k,It looks like a telugu (India) movie AVUNU
dSBsNeYqh-k,I thought Johnny Depp was supposed to be in this? Am.i wrong?
dSBsNeYqh-k,That's disappointing. I thought it was going to be about the original Claude Rains movie.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Imagine being able to turn invisible and stalk the same girl you were with when you were visible. eh?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"How long is the movie?

Universal Pictures: 2 minutes and 25 seconds."
dSBsNeYqh-k,The Dark Universe still has a chance to prove itself that it is still relevant.
dSBsNeYqh-k,After Reading comments is the exact reason why I don‚Äôt watch trailers anymore but rather read the plot. Trailers for awhile have failed the audience who are interested in the movie.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Can't wait for Tom Cruise to show up at the end and DBZ fight the Invisible Man
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Welp, We Can Clearly See That The ""Blacc Guy"" Diez..."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"All she had to do was not go to the reading of the will. Or, not take the money, or move across country."
dSBsNeYqh-k,What happened to Johnny Depp doing this? Is this part of Dark Universal? Is this connected to The Mummy?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Why didn‚Äôt they just make this part of the dark universe it looks awesome
dSBsNeYqh-k,I hope they use the queen song in this...
dSBsNeYqh-k,Oh how cool it would be to become invisible...
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This looks better than the Mummy reboot did, but it would have been nice to see something that represents the H.G. Wells book. Just because its a Invisible Man doesn't mean its Jack Griffin (the hotel Transylvania movies are more faithful to these classic characters; and that's embarrassing). I'll still stay positive until I see more."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Soooo -- ""Sleeping with the Enemy"", except he's invisible."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this part of the Universal Dark Universe?
dSBsNeYqh-k,so I‚Äôm guessing Johnny Depp would‚Äôve played the invisible man... I would‚Äôve liked to see it with him in it but.. Hopefully its good.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Thought Johnny deep was gonna be invincible man during the 1950s

dSBsNeYqh-k,_Hollow Man (2000)_
dSBsNeYqh-k,How thoughtful of Universal to put the whole movie in the trailer so I don't have to go see it!
dSBsNeYqh-k,Anybody know how big the budget is?
dSBsNeYqh-k,the last scene when she managed to see him was a big spoiler and shouldn't put in the trailer
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Looks interesting, but unfortunately it's another case of the trailer showing way too much"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"how to not make a trailer. show the important keypoints in the movie.  Even shows a part that seems too be the ending of the movie. should be at most  0:43 to about 1:12. or something similar. Just something too hype you up, get the feel of it."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Ghayab ho kar sab dikhta hai mai jaha bhi rahu, mujhko koi na dekhe mai sab ko dekho."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Suck it hollowman.

dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow man- ll ü§î
dSBsNeYqh-k,"To everyone thinking the trailer is spoiling everything, the director has said that it doesn‚Äôt.

dSBsNeYqh-k,BOOOOOOOO
dSBsNeYqh-k,Horror Genre + You're crazy is getting boring we see it everytime.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I really hope this isn‚Äôt one of the horror movies where the killer wins just so they can make sequels
Looking at you Brightburn"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this somehow related to 'Hollow Man' in any chance?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Good üëçüèªüëçüèªüî•
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Somebody was standing in front of the camera during every shoot of the movie, probably."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Clicked on the video but didn‚Äôt see any man.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Plot twist: they just runs an asylum & need more patients lol
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Of course, more woke agenda from Hollywood. If a man was invisible, OBVIOUSLY the first thing he would do would be to stalk women, right?  Imagine if the roles were reversed, and it was invisible woman, there would be an uproar."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Don't need to watch the movie now.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Super
dSBsNeYqh-k,She should've bought flour or baby powder and see his footprints and attack himü§£üòÇ

dSBsNeYqh-k,Hindi release plzz
dSBsNeYqh-k,Did any one watched AVUNU Telugu movie or any one felt the same like it is???
dSBsNeYqh-k,Just like Tollywood movie AVUNU
dSBsNeYqh-k,why did they have to show the entire movie in the trailer? i would have been far more entertaining to uncover this delightful plot on our own in the theaters.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"So, a guy discovers the way to become invisible and all he does is to torture his ex wife.  A dumb evil white male if there ever was one.  On top of that, the black good guy comes to the rescue so we get the full SJW combo.    

So fucking fedup with MeToo and leftie propaganda.    I hope the audience for this movie  be invisible, too."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"The Dark Universe continues:

The Mummy
Invisible Man

Can't wait for:
Creature from the Black Lagoon
Frankenstein
Wolfman
Dracula

It looks like the Invisible Man is going to be the living present day evil genius of these monsters. (I imagine Dr. Frankenstein will pass away long before the 21st Century, probably mudered)

Universal, you got my interest."
dSBsNeYqh-k,It looks good but then its gonna take a turn were its gonna be like slender man. Stupid
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Please please be a psychological thriller where it's all in her head, and not just another entry into the failed Universal Monster Cinematic Universe or whatever the fuck it's called"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Yellow alert: female protagonist, nice black dude, evil straight white male. More woke garbage?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Luke!! Love to see him again
dSBsNeYqh-k,The trailer shows too much. At first we are wondering whether it's happening for real or just in her head and then the trailer shows us that it's happening for real. Shitty trailer.

Why would I pay to see this in a theater?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,I thought it was a sequel of hollow man

dSBsNeYqh-k,The black guy dies as proven by 2:22
dSBsNeYqh-k,YIKES
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this connected to the dark universe the mummy
dSBsNeYqh-k,Well well well. If aint the invisible c*nt
dSBsNeYqh-k,This scared me a lot
dSBsNeYqh-k,They showed WAAAAAAY too much.
dSBsNeYqh-k,I want to be able to enjoy this but the fact I didn't even see her try to put baby powder all over the floor to see footsteps makes me kind of irritated. Despite it only being a trailer.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"*Tom the cat, once sprinkled flour on invisible jerry to locate him. Hope that's useful.*"

dSBsNeYqh-k,"Did you know that if you were totally invisible, you would  also be blind? Because light couldn't strike your retinas, it would go right through them. So you wouldn't be able to see."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Fuck that looks goooood
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I wish they had left it ambiguous about whether it was her actually going crazy or if he really turned himself invisible. Once they showed the machine and all the people being tossed around, it kinda ruined it for me."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Is this going to be just another ""men are abusive villains women can't escape"" metaphor movie?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This movie needs alot of explaining,like why would the man turn himself invisible and fake his death?Also,why is there an invisible man stalking the girl in the first place?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Don‚Äôt know how I feel about turning my favorite universal monster films into stuff like this. :/
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I guess this movie is remake of telugu movie 'Avunu'
Story line is very similar"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Whole lot of nope.
dSBsNeYqh-k,It goes from horror to action and idk if I like it. It just feels a bit cliche and the trailer spoiled WAYYYY too much. I‚Äôll wait till it comes out on Netflix or Hulu or something
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Why can't that concept of a good Invisible Man enter occur to these movie creators?
Why not do an invisible man who works as secret agent against evil?
The most pertinent question, why reveal the entire movie plot in the trailer?  ü§î"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Good take on an old classic.  Though Chevy Case‚Äôs is still the funniest ‚òùÔ∏è one.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Whoa, that was quite a movie, only 2:25 minutes"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Wow this looks good.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Want to see a face-off with the invisible man and Gray from Upgrade. The new MCU!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Every modern film- ""Why watch our movie when you can watch the trailer?"""
dSBsNeYqh-k,Awesome!

dSBsNeYqh-k,Why doesn't she throw paint or flour or something at him?
dSBsNeYqh-k,DAAAAMM! That looks ....
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Calling it now. The plot twist is gonna be that the invisible man is actually not her boyfriend, but somebody else."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks like the best invisible man movie thus far!
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this film inspired by H G Wells novel The Invisible Man?

I saw the trailer a second time and lost all tension and atmosphere. hollow man - halloween - an episode the x files - it follows - paranormal activity - gone girl and ... I'm tired. and the invisible woman of fantastic four."
dSBsNeYqh-k,It's stupid but I'm going to see her anyway
dSBsNeYqh-k,you guys need to bring back Felix the cat as a tv series at least do it for the fans
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow man with a new twist....
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow man
dSBsNeYqh-k,When i see blumhouse i know this is gonna be some crazy sh*t
dSBsNeYqh-k,Awesome
dSBsNeYqh-k,It's virtually unrecognizable to the novel.  They could have told the novel story in the modern setting but honestly I'm tired of the modernizing. It's like Universal has an aversion to nineteenth century settings.  This isn't even remotely the plot of the H. G. Wells story.  It's just Lifetime original movie abusive boyfriend fakes his death and turns invisible to make his abused girlfriend look crazy...
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Why on earth do they cut trailers with so much pivotal information? Anyway, gotta see it cause it's ma boy Leigh Whannell doing his thang but, fuck, Universal....learn to cut a trailer."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I can say it is an Unofficial remake of an INDIAN (Telugu) movie ""AVUNU"". Now can anyone say that hollywood is remaking Indian movies...no one right.... It is easy to make fun of one's hardwork.. here is the link of AVUNU movie https://youtu.be/R2tv9lAvKGY"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I'm glad they are remaking the old universal movie. But at the same time, not sure if this is a good idea."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"It‚Äôs not just the trailer, it‚Äôs the whole movie üçø"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Trailer showed entirely too much
dSBsNeYqh-k,Reminds me of that movie hollow man with Kevin bacon lol
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this thrilling
dSBsNeYqh-k,His name is john cena *theme drops*
dSBsNeYqh-k,Yo whole movie is in
dSBsNeYqh-k,WHY DID THEY HAVE TO SHOW THE COPS GETING ATTACKED NOW I KNOW SHE WASNT HALLUCINATING
dSBsNeYqh-k,Yo whole movie is in
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Well well well, if it ain't the invisible cunt"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"The place that this movie comes from is dead, and is not profitable at all for your thinking or your life. You can't perfect it or Improve it, because it's origins are built on all the wrong information. It didn't start from a place of creativity is my point, but it tried to borrow from creativity."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Super
dSBsNeYqh-k,Edgy... Been waiting for Moss to return.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Now what's the point in watching the movie?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Just stop already Universal.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"So it's a 'Hollow Man' remake with 'The Invisible Man' title?  Looks interesting, but I'm disappointed as a Universal Monsters fan."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Reminded me of the old movie hollow man
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollowman
dSBsNeYqh-k,Trailer's end is like Netflix style
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Reveals way to much about the movie. The director is like ""Your wrong"" no it doesn't. Yeah man you did reveal to much. Just like Dark Fate revealed to much. BTW Dark Fate is horrible."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Starring John Cena
dSBsNeYqh-k,Great. Now I don‚Äôt have to watch the movie.
dSBsNeYqh-k,*This Is Haram In Islam*
dSBsNeYqh-k,Luke Crain??
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Not gonna lie, not a fan of the plot. Movie looks creepy though."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This movie is made in Telugu ""avunu"""
dSBsNeYqh-k,Please dubbe tamil also
dSBsNeYqh-k,This movie want Tamil dubbed
dSBsNeYqh-k,"YOU GUYS MADE A MOVIE ABOUT AN ABUSIVE MAN THAT MADE HIMSELF INVISIBLE TO CONTINUE TO ABUSE HIS WIFE /GIRLFRIEND? SO WE ARE SUPPOSE TO GO TO THE THEATER TO WATCH A MOVIE ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WITH A MAN THAT IS INVISIBLE? WOW THAT IS JUST PROMISING, BRAVO! I WOULD RATHER PAY TO SEE HOLLOW MAN BEFORE THIS. THIS IS SAD, THE TITTLE AND IMAGE SEEMED PROMISING BUT THIS IS JUST THE DEATH OF FILM RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Well, thanks for showing me the whole film in over 2 mins."
dSBsNeYqh-k,isn't he the narc from hill house?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Bollywood made this long time back
dSBsNeYqh-k,"First time ever it is same as Ravi babu's AVUNU Telugu movie ""proud moment"""
dSBsNeYqh-k,Does any one know  that she is a Scientologist they should call this movie Xenu the galactic Warrior !!!!üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Interesting premise, but incredibly wasteful. If I could turn invisible, I would definitely not be wasting my time terrorizing people...
There are far more interesting things you can do with invisibility."
dSBsNeYqh-k,so Hollowman 2.0 ????
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This looks trippy! Like, in the end, what if it was all in her head and none of it actually happened?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Just like Kevin Bacons Hollow Man movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hotel Transylvania spin-off
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Gone are the damn days where a trailer  didn't reveal the climax, post climax, almost every death or climatic scene. It truly has become so disheartening to watch movies and know it all. 

I remember the last trailer I saw for a movie that blew my mind was Dreamcatcher."
dSBsNeYqh-k,February? It‚Äôll be easily looked over
dSBsNeYqh-k,Ready to review this oneüôè‚úåüèºüëÄ

dSBsNeYqh-k,"https://youtu.be/KIFJNawbIFQ
Now watch this
I think the director watched this movie and made this movie"
dSBsNeYqh-k,is this biopic movie about  john cena?
dSBsNeYqh-k,This actually looks fucking good
dSBsNeYqh-k,"No. No. No. No no no no no goddammit no, please take your feminazi bullshit away from the classics. This looks like I know what you shit last summer."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Ummm Kevin Bacon made this movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,So is this still the dark universe
dSBsNeYqh-k,I think I like this fresh take on the invisible man.
dSBsNeYqh-k,you know what his weakness is? flour
dSBsNeYqh-k,They missed a perfect opportunity to cast John Cena as the man you can‚Äôt see. Also they could‚Äôve cast Kevin Bacon as the invisible man because of ‚ÄúHollow Man‚Äù
dSBsNeYqh-k,I bet it won't be as good as Hollow Man
dSBsNeYqh-k,Telugu avunu movie copie
dSBsNeYqh-k,Can't she just...I don't know...throw flour on him?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Man, i thought this movie was about an invisible man."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This movie looks great 
But I feel like I saw the entire trailer"
dSBsNeYqh-k,wüò≤w
dSBsNeYqh-k,Story in a nutshell: genuis figures out how to make himself invisible so instead of showing his scientific discovery to the world he uses it to torcher his ex.....this is beautiful
dSBsNeYqh-k,The brothers of the hollow man
dSBsNeYqh-k,The Hollow Man is a good flick.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this still gonna be part of the monster universe they were building?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Showed to much. I won't go watch this now :(
dSBsNeYqh-k,This story is our indian Telugu language ( AVUNU movie) check the trailer in youtube
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow man 2.0
dSBsNeYqh-k,Want to watch
dSBsNeYqh-k,Remember when. This was supposed to have Johnny DEPP in it
dSBsNeYqh-k,U think if a guy could do all that when would put his energy to a c plus lookin bitch
dSBsNeYqh-k,Doesn't look as funny as when Chevy Chase did it.
dSBsNeYqh-k,If your my age then you would know the original invisible man movie was about a science experiment that went wrong and the group just went on with their lives and forgot about the guy they did the experiment on and he tried killing all of them for it
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is one of the worst trailers I have ever seen. I just watched the entire movie. You should have stopped it at the moment his breath shows is the scene.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Oh wow, okay. This might not actually suck!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,THIS WAS AN AD FOR A MUSIC VIDEO AND IT SCARED THE LIVING HELL OUT OF ME
dSBsNeYqh-k,This reminds me of hollow Man 2000
dSBsNeYqh-k,Got a problem detecting body heat? There's an app for that.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Great... pretty much just watched the whole movie. Terrible trailer but the movie does look interesting.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"For you that are getting bored with Holywood, hang on because The Great Tribulation is coming soon!!!!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Oh. I think someone over at Universal needs to explain how marketing works to the trailer people. I had every intention of seeing this movie, until I watched the trailer. It seems to be pretty much the whole thing condensed into two and a half minutes. Now I literally don't have any reason to go see the rest of it."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This movie :
Concept taken from 
Hollywood movie: invisible man
Story taken from :
Tollywood ( India) movie 
""Avunu"""
dSBsNeYqh-k,I wonder how this movie will differentiate itself from Hollow Man.......
dSBsNeYqh-k,Elisabeth Moss and her crazy ass facial expression I love how obnoxious  she can be no wonder she's so great in horror films
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Thanks for letting me see almost the whole movie in the trailer! Only thing I don't know, is how they defeat him. I can live without that. Appreciate you saving me the price of a ticket as well!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,DARK UNIVERSE is rotting somewhere in Universal's basement and this is not a part of it
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Alright Universal, I‚Äôll bite.
Let‚Äôs see it."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks like it could be a decent movie but as usual these days they give away way too much in the trailer.
dSBsNeYqh-k,They just gonna act like Hollow Man didn‚Äôt happen?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"wow, looks pretty good. love that leading lady, very intense and still very beautiful. getting a Nicholson in the Shining vibe, but with the beauty of Evelyn Ankers (and the rage of BOTH). 

NOICE"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Plot twist;


She's crazy."
dSBsNeYqh-k,is this a dark universe movie?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I really hate todays trailers, they reveal too much"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Yeah... Imma see this
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Honestly I'd thought people would be tearing this movie trailer apart. Personally I don't this this looks good. Thought it would focus on science aspect of him turning invisible. Not some cheap attempt to take a good story and twist it into a horror genre. Just my opinion, if it's good and does well, yay for WB"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"She's as attractive as a pile of moss, so the name is fitting."
dSBsNeYqh-k,The most unbelievable part of the movie is not a guy that can turn himself invisible. It's a guy that has 5M and dates a stumpy looking roastie like the one in this movie.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Dw, just Translucent messing around while The Boys are not on duty"
dSBsNeYqh-k,I remember when this came out in 2000 and was called Hollow Man
dSBsNeYqh-k,Twist: she‚Äôs been off her meds and she is the killer/aggressor in the relationship/story
dSBsNeYqh-k,Should have called it The Invisible Man's Girlfriend.
dSBsNeYqh-k,On the fence about this one.
dSBsNeYqh-k,The Invisible Domestic Abuser
dSBsNeYqh-k,How original.. it's Hollow Man but not in a laboratory it's at home with his girlfriend. C'mon Hollywood.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Cool. Just saw the whole movie. That just saved me $15. Thanks.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"SPOILERS.

So, in this trailer, the horror is immediately removed as they show you the answer to the mystery of whether he's a ghost or not... he's not.

Then they show what he did, how he did it, everything he does to her... and then reveal every death except either of the two main characters.

No reason to see this now.. until maybe in a few years once it's been out and you forgot all of this."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Ha, the irony. I'm also invisible 

To life"
dSBsNeYqh-k,I prefer the queen song
dSBsNeYqh-k,Reminds me of Mr. India (a bollywood movie) lol
dSBsNeYqh-k,I'd just go around with a bottle of ketchup spraying everywhere.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Well that was a good movie, thanks guys"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Thankyou universal. They now have a clear presentation of what these universal monster movies should mainly be. HORROR! Dracula untold and the mummy werent terrible, just mediorcre movies with large budgets. This looks fantastic"
dSBsNeYqh-k,SNEEZEKEVINBACONSNEEZE!!!!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Man this is so dumb. Didn't they also make this movie once already? I remember a version of the story where he goes crazy from the serum and tries to kill his wife.
Seriously, if you invented invisibility, would you waste it to torture your ex mentally? Ridiculous."
dSBsNeYqh-k,What's wrong with trailers nowadays ? They show the whole movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,Thanks for giving away the twist *_in_* the goddamn trailer.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Why does this make me think of that episode where spongebob and Patrick were invisible and haunted sandy
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks....Really damn good
dSBsNeYqh-k,Universal studious: seeThat was so hard
dSBsNeYqh-k,H.G. Wells and James Whale must have rolled so hard in their graves that they‚Äôre buried in different countries now.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Manh trailer is killer!!
dSBsNeYqh-k,Follow my insta liamlaird15
dSBsNeYqh-k,"As always, they give too much away in the trailer. You‚Äôve seen the whole movie already, in cliff-note form. üôÑ"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Idk about this i thought it would take place in like the Victorian era not modern day era
dSBsNeYqh-k,Really wish trailer companies would stop showing the whole movie in the trailer....
dSBsNeYqh-k,The last film with a theme like this was Hollow Man
dSBsNeYqh-k,Well they‚Äôre showing everything

dSBsNeYqh-k,"John cena ""you can't see me """
dSBsNeYqh-k,"They actually showed us the whole damn movie. I kept thinking they are going to stop now, but they had to show us the ending."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Elisabeth Moss is amazing
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I did thought this was gonna be H.G. Wells, but I am wrong"
dSBsNeYqh-k,looks pretty unremarkable
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Elisabeth Moss, no thanks. I‚Äôll pass"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Looks alright, just the trailer gave away the entire film"
dSBsNeYqh-k,I guess asking for a proper adaptation of the h.g. wells novel is to much?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Really amazing
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This straight up looks like a Telugu movie called ""Avunu"", looks like many scenes were copied from that movie"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this a remake of the 1933 invisible man or just the same title?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Paint. Just throw paint everywhere. Break a pen and get it on your hands, then run around with your hands out. This is really stupid"
dSBsNeYqh-k,MAN I HATE TRAILERS THAT REVEAL THE WHOLE MOVIE
dSBsNeYqh-k,They just showed the movie WTF man...
dSBsNeYqh-k,I read the hell out of this book when i was younger.
dSBsNeYqh-k,I think john cena is in main role
dSBsNeYqh-k,Missed opportunity to cast John Cena.
dSBsNeYqh-k,This movie looks greattt and crazyyyyy I cant wait for ittttüò±üò±üò±üò±
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is good!
dSBsNeYqh-k,John Cena 's actin is evolvin and he's after an oscar
dSBsNeYqh-k,Let me guess: Another METOO movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,The happening?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hated her in Handmaids Tale but this looks pretty good.
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is a classic horror movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,So the invisible Man just got a bold new reimagining.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks promising
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks great but the trailer itself is complete shit.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I almost slipped this, but am so glad I did not.... finally a movie that isn't a sjw fantasy and has a real story with actual drive to the story."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Elizabeth Moss is the go-to actress for fighting toxic masculinity. She broke the glass ceiling in Mad Men, the Patriarchy in Handmaid's Tale, and now she'll take on gaslighting in the Invisible Man.  If they ever make a #MeToo movie about Harvey Weinstein, she'll have to play Rose McGowen's character"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Damn this looks good
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Looks good to me, better than the Mummy at least."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I'm the Invisible Man
I'm the Invisible Man
It's incredible how I can
See right through you!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Are people really interested in this? This looks ridiculous.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Man Universal got some trash trailers. Movie looks good but who‚Äôs your editor?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Finally another Dark Universe mov..... Oh wait.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Interesting but I'll probably just see it to support my man from hill house and Harriet  still pressed about the inbetween being cancelled that was a damn good show
dSBsNeYqh-k,SLEEPING IN YOUR BED
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow Man?
dSBsNeYqh-k,So you make yourself invisible to torture your ex-girlfriend running out on you? The dude must be a sociopath if he doesn‚Äôt have a plan B or a way back to visibility. Or just not that much on forethought
dSBsNeYqh-k,So it's Hollow Man?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"""I have something that can prove what I'm experiencing""


Yeah, lady, its called a camera. Upgrade to a thermal imaging camera if you want - you've got $5 million on the line."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Blum House version of Hollow-Man
dSBsNeYqh-k,blumhouse though :/
dSBsNeYqh-k,*I remember the movie The Hollow Man.*
dSBsNeYqh-k,Shows way too much in the trailer. Hope I can forget this movie is a thing by February and can just enjoy it spoiler free
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Final Countdown!
Universal Monster."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Thanks for the whole movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,All I have to say is damn
dSBsNeYqh-k,"So... Hollow Man, yeah?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Looks more like another woke shit, destroyed the original story"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Diversity quota casting like Child's Play?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"They gave away way too much in this trailer. We know the whole plot, how he‚Äôs not dead, and that she learns to fight back. I probably would have enjoyed this movie, but I probably won‚Äôt a second time now."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"There once was a story about a man that could turn invisible. I thought it was only a story until it happened to me. You see, there's this stuff called quicksilver that bends light. My brother and some scientists made into a synthetic gland and that's where I come in. You see, I was facing life in prison, so we made a deal, they put the gland in my brain, I walk free. The operation was a complete success, but that's where everything started to go wrong."
dSBsNeYqh-k,OFREDüòç
dSBsNeYqh-k,While watching the trailer who is missing the Hollow Man
dSBsNeYqh-k,"classic ""i just showed you the whole film in the trailer"" syndrome"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Just another hollywood movie where they vilify men.
dSBsNeYqh-k,This trailer basically just showed the entirety of the movie.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Could have been named Hollowman 3
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is really similar to AVUNU telugu movie...
dSBsNeYqh-k,isn't the invisible man supposed to be more like a pissed off gentleman than a stalking sociopath?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"It seems like it is an adaption of Telugu movie ""AVUNU""."
dSBsNeYqh-k,So I carry around a few cans of spray paint. Oh there you are mr. Invisible Man. Bang
dSBsNeYqh-k,"So this is the first plunge since Blumhouse took over. Interesting take. She's a great actress, but honestly it's so damn hard to get past the fact that she's a Scientologist. And as usual, they showed WAY too much of the movie in the trailer. I hope they set ""The Wolf Man"" back in its original time. You don't have to modernize the time period to make these good movies."
dSBsNeYqh-k,I mean... i might watch it when its out on netflix lol maybe..
dSBsNeYqh-k,It's Name should be Invisible ghost...
dSBsNeYqh-k,Damn!! john cena did great job in this.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Sorry producers, somebody already came up with this same concept like over 5 times already. :/"
dSBsNeYqh-k,The trailer showed way too much! I still can't wait to see it
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I was already interested in this movie, but now I'm fucking hyped."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Wait!!  They just showed EVERYTHING!!! I was very interested but then they took away of the mystery, suspense and intrigue by showing that he is invisible (and its not in her head which would have been GREAT if you never knew until the end) , and that he's NOT dead, then how he made himself invisible via a machine, then she finds him ..etc .. I mean seriously!!??? are you kidding me? Terrible way to market this!!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Really. . ?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Who keeps making the decision to upload the whole movie onto youtube? What's even better is that it condenses it down into most/some of the high tension points of the movie. So even if it was good, it's still competently spoiled."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Its dumb to make the invisible man a simple horror movie. The premise has a lot more to offer. I pretty sure kevin bacon version is better than this film
dSBsNeYqh-k,Follow me in tiktok mr_Althamash
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I've read a book named ""the invisible man"" but it's not same ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Disliked by invisible people
dSBsNeYqh-k,"That was a great movie, nice of you to release it for free! Bit short though"
dSBsNeYqh-k,this is like jithan movie.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this a remake of original Invisible Man?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Yeah, I'm not watching that."
dSBsNeYqh-k,IS it a REMAKE of HOLLOW MAN
dSBsNeYqh-k,Dear hollywood stop copying our Mr.X
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Hell yeah!
.
‡¶ñ‡ßá‡¶≤‡¶æ ‡¶π‡¶¨‡ßá!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Return of the DUCU!
dSBsNeYqh-k,Someone call the boys
dSBsNeYqh-k,Can we please have at least one scene where he skips along a road in his pants pls?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"So her husband invented invisibility and fake his own death to just hunt his wife around to make her look crazy to not take insurance money


THIS PLOT IS SOO STUPID AND BORING"
dSBsNeYqh-k,John cena spotted‚ô•
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Might be worth seeing based on the screenwriter/director alone:
Leigh Whannell is an Australian screenwriter, producer, director, and actor. He is best known for writing films directed by his friend James Wan, including Saw, Dead Silence, Insidious, and Insidious: Chapter 2. Whannell has directed two films, Insidious: Chapter 3, released in 2015, and Upgrade, released in 2018"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Its look like AVUNU movie telugu
dSBsNeYqh-k,"They shouldn't have revealed the camo suit outline near the end. The mystery of how, would've been much better."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Just watched the movie, thanks ."
dSBsNeYqh-k,I just don't get it... how hard to buy a thermographic camera...
dSBsNeYqh-k,I think is this just like our  telugu movie AVNU MOVIE
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow man 2
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Elizabeth Moss gets top billing on a movie titled ""The Invisible Man"". Once again, woke cinema hard at work. Hope this film tanks harder than the current Terminator film."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks promising...
dSBsNeYqh-k,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeDH_0Q9ylY Same fucking movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,"As long as they don't show a post credits for the Dark Universe, I'll watch it."
dSBsNeYqh-k,THE CLASSICAL ONE‚ù§Ô∏è
dSBsNeYqh-k,"What the fuck ?! 
Is there anything left to see ?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Ok so looked good til you just decided to show me a 2 minute version of the movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,on heloween be good)
dSBsNeYqh-k,Try getting an invisible restraining order
dSBsNeYqh-k,"üëéTerrible... Seriously this looks shite.
What an Insult to H.G Wells.
*1933, with Claude Rains, pure Classic...
Just gonna wait for this to bomb.."
dSBsNeYqh-k,My nanny does that and no one believes me.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Easy solution: thermal imagery
dSBsNeYqh-k,Get some spray paint
dSBsNeYqh-k,Why didn't he fuck her ?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Why didn't the invisible man just kill her and give her mercyüòÅüòÇ
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Is this going to be one of those movie plots where, for 3/4 of the film, she's convinced it's her supposedly dead ex who's ""haunting"" her and she sets out to prove it, and towards the end the twist is revealed that her ex really is dead and that someone else is attacking her?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks like this ain‚Äôt the Dark Universe they were aiming for now.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Shit thats John Cena
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is more hollow man than the invisible man.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"oh my soul, im going to go lose my shit, this looks like so a awesome movie!!!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Nobody:

Queen fans:.                  
I'm the invisible Man üòé"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Dark universe?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Dave Batista - invisible man lol
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Worst trailer ever. The whole idea was to wonder if she was really crazy or not. Now we know. And I feel like I've seen the three acts of the movie, condensed in 3mn. The hype is dead. Please learn how to make correct trailers. Best regards."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Watch ""Avunu"" Telugu Film.... I just feel like it..."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Spoiler Alert: He's about to get away with it and then he farts loudly leading to the cops tackling and arresting him.
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is f##king incredible man
dSBsNeYqh-k,Does this tie in with the universe of the tom cruise mummy movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,i thought it was teresa palmer in the thumbnail
dSBsNeYqh-k,Finally the Movie in which John Cena is in his real Character.  Or is this biopic of cena.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks pretty cheap and lame to me.  I figured this was a Netflix movie.  I'll be shocked if this attracts a huge audience at the multiplex.
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks great!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Good trailer, or super-cut.  Saves me time watching the full movie."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Hey, no one told me John Cena was gonna be in this one!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,It's kevin BACON!!!!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"The Invisible Man 
 Starring:  John Cena & Elizabeth Moss"
dSBsNeYqh-k,The question is how he did turn out to become the invisible man? Does he use the scientific chemical in his body? Can anyone explain ?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This film's plot

infrared camera: am I joke to you?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is he supposed to be a Superhero?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Disappointed, I thought it would be adaptation of H. G. Wells novel :( However this turns out to be, we'll still have classic movie version."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Freaking amazing trailer.....
dSBsNeYqh-k,I am waiting
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is it John Cena??
dSBsNeYqh-k,Did I just watched the whole movie?
dSBsNeYqh-k,The whole plot...
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Why i think this movie is combination of ""hallow man"" and telugu movie ""Avunu""?????"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Kevin Bacon would've been proud.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Third time is the charm?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks interesting‚ô•
dSBsNeYqh-k,I like the original Invisible Man from 1933 with Claude Rains.
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is a Me Too movie. Not The Invisible Man .
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this still part of the Dark Universe?
dSBsNeYqh-k,must be john cena
dSBsNeYqh-k,I wanna watch
dSBsNeYqh-k,At last i hot what to see next
dSBsNeYqh-k,"So now I know who the invisible man is, why he does it, how he did it and that the protagonist finds a way to make him visible and then probably kill him. If you guys want a good thrill watch Parasite atleast it's a movie where the trailer didn't spoil it."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Why do film studios always feel the need to show the whole movie in a 2 1/2 minute trailer?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks awful
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hay this is telugu language movie right
dSBsNeYqh-k,"They just spoiled the whole movie
Wtf stupids"
dSBsNeYqh-k,the invisible man can fuck anybody and anywhere
dSBsNeYqh-k,Another retake on an old classic.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Oh ok Hollow Man 2020.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow man
dSBsNeYqh-k,U can't see me
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this movie released in hindi?
dSBsNeYqh-k,It reminded me of 'Avunu' Telugu movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,John Cena movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,Just makes the original look even better
dSBsNeYqh-k,Glad to see you can fit the entire movie in a trailer now
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks terrible sadly another movie I won't watch.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow man 2?
dSBsNeYqh-k,HollowMan ( #KevinBacon ) look it up üòÇüòÇüòÇüòú
dSBsNeYqh-k,Waste of time.

dSBsNeYqh-k,The DUCU is getting made after all
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Basically another version of  ""Hollow Man"" from 2000 with Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Who all remember hollow man
dSBsNeYqh-k,"okay,so when did they decide to remake of 'hollow man' !????"
dSBsNeYqh-k,This movie horor like power magic have she  is girl the sacread riana akhirnya hollywood  film nya menempatkan kekuatan the sacread riana. I gues so
dSBsNeYqh-k,"It looks like a TV-quality film, but thanks for letting us see it this early for free."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Cool. I dont need to see the movie now.
dSBsNeYqh-k,So she can just throw powder or flour on the floor to see where he is. I mean really
dSBsNeYqh-k,I was waiting for hollow man 3üòî
dSBsNeYqh-k,Dark universe still alives
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks good. I can't wait to see it. The last one I saw was with elisabeth shue and kevin bacon? a good one but this looks better.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow Man!
dSBsNeYqh-k,Oh i thought this was gonna be a movie about john cena
dSBsNeYqh-k,I JUST WANNA SEE IT TO
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Cool. Though, to become the invisible because of being a stalker, nah. I‚Äôd rather he got that way after the effects of it. Such as the original."
dSBsNeYqh-k,HOLLOW MAN
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks great but they didn't have to show us the whole thing.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Are we supposed to believe that this movie is a reboot version of ‚ÄúHOLLOW MAN‚Äù????
dSBsNeYqh-k,So excited
dSBsNeYqh-k,The asshole man
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow Man 2020
dSBsNeYqh-k,Wow thanks I just watched the movie for free
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This looks...disappointing, sadly."
dSBsNeYqh-k,I'm loving the use of empty space! It reminds me of It Follows where you are unsure where It is
dSBsNeYqh-k,Oh god. They are making another remake. zzzzzzzzz....zzzzzzz
dSBsNeYqh-k,Invisible guest ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è but man üë®

dSBsNeYqh-k,"Universal: "" *The Invisible Man* ""
 Everyone thinks its scary a hell!

dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks good but dam they just showed the whole movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this the invisible guy from the boys?
dSBsNeYqh-k,It's time to call the  Ghostbusters
dSBsNeYqh-k,Why the hell do they always give away the end of the movie?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Yeah great... after watching this I basically saw the whole movie, thanks."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"we do not even need to see a movie, trailers nowadays shows everything whats important in a whole movie..."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks stupid
dSBsNeYqh-k,Noone:
dSBsNeYqh-k,"You had me at ""Screenplay by Leigh Whannell: Directed by Leigh Whannell"" üò≤üòÉ"

dSBsNeYqh-k,f*ck that is a crazy trailer.... release it in Netflix üò≠üò≠üò≠ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Well, I just got the entire movie except for like the last 5%, not gonna bother watching it now, I already experienced it lol"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"The main problem with the Dark Universe was that they chose the mummy reboot to begin with. Mummy was too new to be rebooted and yes the script was awful. 
They should have started with some old movies Frankenstein, Invisible man  and rest. 
Plus,Johnny depp would have been great and I hope he does a monster movie later in future."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Realistically though, he wouldn't be able to stalk her for even half the time, assuming she's in a public place, without being picked up by heat sensors."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I feel like I've seen the whole movie.


While I appreciate that Universal is trying to save me a few bucks, I would've really liked to watch this in a theater."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Why movies so racist? There is not a single east-asian here. So racist and so ignorant. Shame on you universal pictures.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Looks like shit. How many weeks over this damn movie will she need to figure out a plan to see him? I would just get  flour everywhere on the floor, and a few cans of spray paint and spray all around me. Let an invisible motherfucker try me lol"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Why include the entire twist of the movie in the trailer? As well as the whole damn climax where we see the main character complete her revenge arc, and see her friend beaten to death. I feel like I‚Äôve already watched the movie."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks soo good!
dSBsNeYqh-k,Where's Abbott and Costello?????
dSBsNeYqh-k,I bet this movie turned to be comedy if we see it from that invisible man point of view üòÇ
dSBsNeYqh-k,So glad they showed the entire movie in the trailer because now I don't have to watch this convoluted mess.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Now I just want to watch Kevin Bacon taunt and creepily stalk people and then brutally murder them
dSBsNeYqh-k,Anyone else see the first one?

dSBsNeYqh-k,"No thanks, I‚Äôd rather watch the Claude Raines version"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this dark universe?

dSBsNeYqh-k,Finally...JOHN CENA have a great movie...as a villain...
dSBsNeYqh-k,"""Well well well, if it ain't the invisible cunt."""
dSBsNeYqh-k,Damnit I thought this would finally be a genuine reboot of the HG Wells story with Claude Rains

dSBsNeYqh-k,John Cena.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"okay I only made it a minute in and I can tell this trailer is going to show way too much. I'm hooked, I'm a big fan of the original and I'm glad this isn't just someone trying to recreate a classic. no one can ever be Claude Rains. you got my ticket, don't let the fans down please."

dSBsNeYqh-k,"Stupid, if the dude was invisible she could have easily made him visible. So many ways. Just derping around like this is so incompetent."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Third time‚Äôs a charm.
dSBsNeYqh-k,This kinda spoiled it.
dSBsNeYqh-k,DUCU forever!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Wow, well this looks like butthole..."
dSBsNeYqh-k,I wonder if the Invisible Man will wear bandages and a rubber nose sometime in the movie.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Wow, Y'all dropped that ""Dark Universe"" shit faster than the flash man....lol"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"He's pretty lucky she didn't think about buying a butt load of flour.
It could've been a short film.
Also, these people are seriously missing out on using ""Invisible Man"" by Queen for the music in this trailer."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollowman 2.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"just use the color spray, please."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Woow what a shitty trailer... They could've kept it a secret that its not a ghost but that he made himself invisible but NOOO they had to reveal it in the trailer itself that he's not dead... Good job idiots.
dSBsNeYqh-k,So I take it this isn't a part of the dark universe?
dSBsNeYqh-k,lol thanks for showing the whole movie plot for free
dSBsNeYqh-k,Why did you show the whole thing?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Holy shit this looks good....I hope it's a really good thriller
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Finally, a casting opportunity for dead people"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Now THIS is how to bring back the Dark Universe.
dSBsNeYqh-k,They did great on the costume design .. very accurate
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Reminds me of some song lyrics from final destination . ""there is someone walking behind you"" The song is ""Turn around, look at me"" And the first few lyrics are kind of stalker-like, like the vibe this movie puts out."
dSBsNeYqh-k,This shit look lit as fuck. I got hyped just watching the trailer.
dSBsNeYqh-k,This trailer was like the whole damn movie.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"To the point story telling, I love it!!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"i  should really stop watching trailers, i've seen the movie now"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Welp.  I pretty much seen the entire movie.  Thanks Blumhouse!
dSBsNeYqh-k,I want to like this but it looks bland
dSBsNeYqh-k,Why show the entire film plot?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Disappointed to see that this isn't The Invisible Man from the novel.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I'll take ""screenplays that were re-written more than a dozen times in two years"" for 500, Alex.  Seriously though, this looks like a pretty good idea for a movie."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow man is that you?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Blumhouse: Pumps out a thousand shitty Into the Dark ""movies"" designed to give you the feeling of a random Tumblr-user scolding you.
Also Blumhouse: ""I'm not sure if you want this, but here's a trailer for a (seemingly) compelling, unique, well-constructed, thriller."""
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Is there anything else left out? Looks like, the trailer showed pretty much the entire movie."
dSBsNeYqh-k,I thought it will adaptation of novel
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow Man
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I'm glad to see them bringing this movie back from the dead. 
Kevin bacon did a great job as the invisible man."
dSBsNeYqh-k,GIVE ME BACK MY SON!
dSBsNeYqh-k,So that‚Äôs where dad went
dSBsNeYqh-k,Just splash him with some paint. easy
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks a lot better than it has any right to be and I‚Äôm all in
dSBsNeYqh-k,"i literally forgot about it before the trailer ended
this looks shit"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Seems like an interesting premise, unfortunately they showed the whole movie in the trailer."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I actually liked Hollow Man, so this should be really good."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"üé∂I always know where you are, you never know where I am
You got me sneaking around like the invisible man
You'll never know where I've gone, you've gone and done it again
You've got me sneaking around like the invisible man
Going once, going twice, f**k this I'm goneüé∂"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I‚Äôm translucent bitch, protector of the innocent mother fu.... **Car Hits Him**"
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is a true story
dSBsNeYqh-k,Wow this looks actually good as shit
dSBsNeYqh-k,I hope the story comes out clean as possible and that he could start a horror-verse
dSBsNeYqh-k,The way they Showed The TiTLes .. at the End I ThouGht .. Oh! It wiLL premier on NetFLiX üòí
dSBsNeYqh-k,"What a dumbass trailer, literally spoiled the main intrigue of the fucking movie"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Thanks, trailer, for letting us know what happens.


Saved me a ticket buy."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Geezus why do they always show the whole movie... lol
dSBsNeYqh-k,Well well well...if it ain‚Äôt the invisible cunt.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Awesome
dSBsNeYqh-k,I feel like they showed the ending...
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks nothing like Invisible Man though......
dSBsNeYqh-k,This trailer showed way too much.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this part of the dark universe?
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is nothing like the original story.... this is more like Hollow Man.
dSBsNeYqh-k,I hate it when no one believes the main character. Even if the main character weren't crazy before or the other people have basically no proof that the person is lying. That just makes for a bad plot. This movie instead should be about someone help her find the truth and proof that she's not crazy. But I have a feeling the whole movie no one will believe and they will see her a crazy and she will convince herself she must be crazy. Until she has the MacGuffin piece of evidence and then things will go crazy.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I personally think that 2017's _The Mummy_ wasn't that bad. Too bad, they had cancelled the Dark Universe.
So are we going to have Dr Jekyll and My Hyde standalone movie after this?? üòå I love the story of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.
Btw this remake looks nice. And Elisabeth Moss in this movie is a plus for me. I like her _The Handmaid's Tale_ . üòç"
dSBsNeYqh-k,The director will use the same camera work as Upgrade... which I'm a fan of !!
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looked good and was interested until they showed the whole movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,So at what point does Russell Crowe recruit Mr. Sociopath to help him fight Frankenstein?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Can't wait for when they team up with Tom Cruise as the Mummy! Wait...
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow man rebooted
dSBsNeYqh-k,I mean it looks good but once again the entire movie is in the trailer
dSBsNeYqh-k,"So, if the guy is alive but invisible, who is that dead guy that apparently looks just like him?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,So is this Hallow man ?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"It doesn't feel too much like HG Wells or even Claude Raines.

Not horror nor science fiction.

Curious though, is this an attempt to try to salvaged or resurrect earlier failed attempts at building a ""monsters"" universe akin to the MCU or the DCEU using your properties from the 30s and 40s? (possibly 50s if the creature from the Black lagoon is involved)

If so, then please get it right, it could be fantastic if you put the right people in charge of it."
dSBsNeYqh-k,She should have just Home Alone'd him
dSBsNeYqh-k,This reminds me of The Hollow Man which I'm guessing was based on the same book.
dSBsNeYqh-k,It looks good but once again the trailer gave away all the best parts. Probably would have paid to see it if they cut it 15 seconds shorter.
dSBsNeYqh-k,I don't know.. it's 2019.
dSBsNeYqh-k,DarkUniverse or nah?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Love to see the entire plot of the movie in the trailer
dSBsNeYqh-k,Amazing how one trailer is better than an entire 200 million + film
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks better than The Mummy
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks creepy and Elisabeth Miss I the lead??? U know this is gonna be a good movie.
dSBsNeYqh-k,hollow man
dSBsNeYqh-k,I could've stopped the trailer halfway and it would be even better!
dSBsNeYqh-k,2:14 awful acting
dSBsNeYqh-k,How does a man invisible man scary. Honestly
dSBsNeYqh-k,Now this looks Good!
dSBsNeYqh-k,So we essentially see every scene in that trailer...
dSBsNeYqh-k,reminds me of death stranding things
dSBsNeYqh-k,Next thing we'll see is the invisible man fighting the mummy
dSBsNeYqh-k,"‚ÄúI shall offer my secret to the world with all its terrible power! The nations of the world will bid for it ‚Äî thousands, millions! The nation that wins my secret can sweep the world with invisible armies. Don‚Äôt you see what it means? Power! Power to rule! To make the world grovel at my feet! Power I said! Power to walk into the gold vaults of the nations, into the secrets of kings, into the Holy of Holies; power to make multitudes run, squealing in terror‚Ä¶ at the touch of my little invisible finger. Even the moon‚Äôs frightened of me, frightened to death. The whole world‚Äôs frightened to death.‚Äù"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Actually looks pretty good
dSBsNeYqh-k,"from the maker of ""Upgrade"", DEFINITELY waiting for good twisted ending here."
dSBsNeYqh-k,I never ‚Äúsaw‚Äù this coming
dSBsNeYqh-k,Awesome! I can't wait
dSBsNeYqh-k,WHERE IS MY BANDAGED AND FEDORA WEARING GUY?! COME ON UNIVERSAL WE WANT THIS UNIVERSE TO WORK BUT IF YOU FUCK THIS UP JUST LIKE YOU FUCKED UP THE MUMMY AND DRACULA THEN YOU SHOULD JUST CALL IT QUITS
dSBsNeYqh-k,Dear blumhouse! Please bring back the dark universe!!!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"That was a good movie love when trailers show the whole movie and ruin it 
Brand new unsigned east coast lyrical ,gangsta,¬† spiritual hip hop https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7OOIqRwvHtf_bfMmQMDXf3QKkFGaXF3z"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Umm so you figured out a way to make yourself invisible and you use it to stalk some broad.. seriously??? What a wasteüôÑ
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Meh. Would be better as a comedy. This isn't scary, just boring and dramatic. Not my thing really. UPGRADE (2018) was excellent award material though! Loved that one. ‚òï"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"this chick can act, gonna be a good watch"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I want it to end with she was actually imagining it. That would be interesting, kinda like Shutter Island"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Honestly this looks like complete shit
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Huh ?

My ex girlfriend as elizibeth moss the feminist. 
Five minutes and a bat. Short movie..."
dSBsNeYqh-k,The dark universe has returned.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Soooo am I the only who noticed the smoke from the fire comes from the window?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Real easy way to prove this.. just carry a big ole bag of flour with you where ever you go.
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is the second modern Universal ‚Äúmonster‚Äù movie where the lead actor is a Scientologist.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Cool, now I know everything about the movie"
dSBsNeYqh-k,From the director and cinematographer of Upgrade ? Count me in !
dSBsNeYqh-k,Just make a movie about the universal monsters maze.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow man 3
dSBsNeYqh-k,Umm woah.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Thanks for the whole movie, he's xyz controlling generic angry male character and she's a borderline suicidal person who fell victim to him (totally wasn't the fact that this guy is rolling in it) but even funnier is in this trailer we all know the exact arc of the movie because it's been made hundreds of times already. Slow start, lots of panning shots of her in some cozy rich people clothes while drinking her morning tea followed by a light but obvious-to-come jump scare of the guy putting his hand on her shoulder from behind while she's mindlessly staring out one of those massive windows. Mid section is generic thriller panic moments where she'll be looking behind herself, be in a state of disorder which obviously leads to her downfall because she didn't bother to do anything about it sooner (generic trope in these movies) then the ending section is just her running about frantically until she conveniently rage-kills him due to a mind numbing excuse of some sort that his time is UP or invisibility wore off because of x reason made up on the spot and the movie ends with her again drinking some kind of tea or latte in a shop somewhere with cozy clothes on and probably ends up seeing her supposedly invincible now ex-partner walking across the street as she gazes past (over the left shoulder) the guy sitting across from her."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"The trailer should have ended at 01:20 (until that point I was really exited), but then they show the whole movie!! WTF"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I thought everyone is gender swapping these days. Oh, I get it, only if its a good guy, not a creep, because only men can be creeps, right? Pass."
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is way intense than Hollow man
dSBsNeYqh-k,When you want to make a movie but no one wants to be the bad guy.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Incredible short film! Tells a 3 act story in 2.5 minutes!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Seem more ""invisible stalker """
dSBsNeYqh-k,The Invisable man played by John Cena
dSBsNeYqh-k,Sleeping with the Enemy meets Hollow Man...
dSBsNeYqh-k,The whole movie huh
dSBsNeYqh-k,I love it when they show the entire movie in the trailer. $$$ saved.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Kevin Bacon did it better. This trailer would be a lot better if Elizabeth Moss was invisible too.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Thanks for playing the whole movie assholes.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I have faith in Leigh because he did the very underrated UPGRADE, but this looks way too much like a subpar Netflix series. Also, I dunno if it's just me, but I find the main lead here unlikeable...I thought I was supposed to cheer for her but she gives out a bad vibe somehow."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"""Well, well, well, if it ain't the Invisible Cunt"""
dSBsNeYqh-k,Anyone else think this actress is getting totally typecast
dSBsNeYqh-k,Blumhouse is shit. Why pick them? What's your criteria ?
dSBsNeYqh-k,This has the potential to be a masterpiece
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Hollywood : Ok so we need to make this movie but we can‚Äôt afford another actor

Hollywood Guy : In got it! We make him invisible!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Now THIS is how you reboot the franchise
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Well, I guess this means the Dark Universe is still going strong."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This is basically Hollow Man remake except with more Focus on revenge, abuse and very little science from what it seems like but looks better then the Mummy from 2017"
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks really bad....
dSBsNeYqh-k,Absalom vs Nami
dSBsNeYqh-k,I was waiting for a John Cena horror movie!! Can't wait!üëçüëç
dSBsNeYqh-k,I dont think this the Dark Universe. It's more like Hollow Man reboot
dSBsNeYqh-k,"And now we know how the movie goes down, thank you trailer"
dSBsNeYqh-k,This legit looks awful.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow man: am i joke to you?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Elizabeth Moss looks like a crazy person
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Wasn't the Hollow Man already a loose adaptation of ""The Invisible Man""?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Universal Pictures producing this The Invisible Man movie might be one of two things... Them saying that the Dark Universe is dead... Or that they might be keeping a very crafty surprise out of the trailers because that's Invisible Man was NOT Johnny Depp.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Trailer spoils too much
dSBsNeYqh-k,an unofficial sequel to Kevin bacons hollow man.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Tom Cruise: Ah shit here we go again
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Wow this trailer spoils so much, we know the cop that tries to help her dies."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This is so ironic, because when she was a little girl, Elisabeth Moss did an  episode of Batman the animated series where she was the daughter of a villain who can make himself invisible. And now she ends up doing this. despite that this has nothing to do with that episode or Batman, you can see it like a spiritual sequel since its Elisabeth Moss and she's facing off with an invisible man again."
dSBsNeYqh-k,INCREDIBLE HOW YOU CAN... SEE RIGHT THROUGH ME... (Queen fans anyone)
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This movie is practically saying, ""Ladies and gentlemen, watch this movie if you want to learn how to successfully stalk your crush""."
dSBsNeYqh-k,It succeeds in the unknown.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Huh. Another trailer that shows the whole movie. Hollywood, you silly boys."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Remember the dark universe?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Uh Hollow Man. Which I prefer over another trash reboot by Blumhouse. This is what happens when u get one good reboot everybody wants your shit then you just start pumping shit out for the üí∞
dSBsNeYqh-k,Now I don't need to watch the movie. All three acts summed up in two and a half minutes.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Holy shit this looks amazing
dSBsNeYqh-k,So is the Dark Universe back on?
dSBsNeYqh-k,This Is In Dark Universe Isn‚Äôt It?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I‚Äôm hoping he wears the OG outfit just for one scene as an Easter egg.

The release date worries me."
dSBsNeYqh-k,They should make the Uninvisible Man about a man who's not invisible.
dSBsNeYqh-k,2:05 did anyone else get Upgrade vibes?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"To those who keep asking if this is part of Universal's DARK UNIVERSE, it's not. That franchise got scrapped after the critical and financial failure of THE MUMMY (2017). Now, can we get a reboot of THE MUMMY that takes place in Egypt for 85% of the movie?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I dont know the plot will be good or not,  but i know Elizabeth Moss is a great actress"
dSBsNeYqh-k,This trailer would have been better if they didn't show so much. Kinda have I idea how this whole thing plays out. Hope I'm wrong.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Okay üôÑüëåüèæ
dSBsNeYqh-k,wtf! they pretty much showed the whole movie...smh
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks pretty cool actually but I feel like the trailer spoiled all the beats of the whole movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,"And again - blumhouse movie trailer that looks cool, but you feel that you already watched the entire movie..."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Holy shit! This looks fucking cool. 
I was expecting this to be lame, or unoriginal.. but im happily disappointed!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Everyone saying this looks interesting depresses me. It's generic and tired and so desperate to look interesting that the trailer gives everything away.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Wow this movie was short
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I didn't see that coming
Specially after how the mummy bombed at the box office"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Good, now that I've seen the movie I don't need to go watch it in theater. Thanks universal."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Okay, I will admit...this looks interesting"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"A movie about a woman who's driven into false hysteria, starring an actress best known for a TV series that gins up false hysteria."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Hey, this isn‚Äôt Queen!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,I hope John Cena gets an Oscar for this.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Cool. Feels like I know the entire movie now.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Well well well if it isn't the invisible cunt
dSBsNeYqh-k,0:49 when you just brushed and you want people to know it
dSBsNeYqh-k,"The Invisible Man to Wonder Woman ""I don't know but my ass is killin' me!"""
dSBsNeYqh-k,In Blumhouse WE TRUST!!!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Thank you for showing me THE WHOLE MOVIE!! Know what happened, & I don't have to see it in theatres."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"It's _The Invisible Man_ as made by Lifetime.
""Because invisible men are terrible and will hurt you."""
dSBsNeYqh-k,"From the writer and producer of Saw and Insidious, Leigh Whannell's The Invisible Man looks promosing to me"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Sigh* well... sure.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Fucking yes. After that Mummy flop, you go back to the basics. You choose a ""monster"" which requires very little CGI and you make a horror movie out of it. This honestly looks great."
dSBsNeYqh-k,This actually looks good
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks sooo good gives me hope and excitement
dSBsNeYqh-k,"That guy is a genius , a sociopath for sure but a genius nonetheless"
dSBsNeYqh-k,STOOPID
dSBsNeYqh-k,Guess they found a way to make their Dark Universe work; hire people who actually know how to make horror films.
dSBsNeYqh-k,*John Cena finally gets his movie!*
dSBsNeYqh-k,Johnny Depp?
dSBsNeYqh-k,üêê
dSBsNeYqh-k,"""Hollow Man Part 2"""
dSBsNeYqh-k,Just copied the movie 'Hollow Man'... Watched it when I was in school
dSBsNeYqh-k,Didn't they already make this movie with Kevin Bacon?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Who plays The Invisible Man? John Cena?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Methinks THIS is how Universal SHOULD'VE handled ""Dracula Untold"" and ""The Mummy 2017."" But, better late than never. :)"
dSBsNeYqh-k,FLOPüëé
dSBsNeYqh-k,This wouldn‚Äôt be the best Valentine‚Äôs Day date idea...
dSBsNeYqh-k,"There is a movie like this in telugu in india , the movie name is called ""avunu"""
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Why is nobody pointing out us, Elizabeth Moss is in both us and this"
dSBsNeYqh-k,why they would spoil the whole movie tho? wtf
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Wait, so Universal's Dark Universe is still a thing! Cool!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,If he doesn't turn a cat invisible it's not worth it smh
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this part of the dark universe?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks good
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this part of the Dark Universe cuz we haven't had a Dark Universe Flim since 2017
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks cool
dSBsNeYqh-k,"*Hold up*
*John Cena is the invisible man!*"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This was what I expected and feared, it's your typical 2010s horror film than the universal monsters. This is only Invisible Man in concept and name only."
dSBsNeYqh-k,channel the thetins
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Wait, how do you expect Moss's character to give 5 million dollars to the invisible man movie?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this base on the 1933 invisible man because if so where the invisible man hes not wearing his hat
dSBsNeYqh-k,Well well if it ain't the invisible cunt
dSBsNeYqh-k,I sit through an Invisible Man trailer and the only thing I'm walking away with here is that my boy Jack Griffin isn't in it......fuck Universal
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Eh look, the invisible man has been shown, now we don't have to go the theater to see him now."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"If this movie turns out a complete success, then we can finally get the Universal Monster shared universe we deserve."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Where's Johnny Depp?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Wow! One heck of a twist to the known story.
dSBsNeYqh-k,This. Is. Scary. Good.
dSBsNeYqh-k,It can be invisible woman
dSBsNeYqh-k,Dark universe??? Hmmm
dSBsNeYqh-k,I remember when everyone was saying this would be trash and it looks awesome.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"thanks for the whole movie, enjoyed it!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,What is with people turning invisible and going mad? Can we plz have some friendly invisibles?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Well, no need to watch the film now. This was basically the whole film cut down to two and a half minutes. Zero intrigue, zero thrills. Less is more when it comes to trailers."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Ironic that a trailer for a movie with this title would show too much.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Did they show us the whole fucking movie?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"people keep trying to figure out the twist, i think it might be the husband wasn't actually abusive and the wife was. so he does this to get revenge. when he runs at the car and smashes it i cant explain that. but i think that would a more interesting twist than she just insane. instead the main character your following is actually the villian."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Don‚Äôt we have heat googles now or UAVs?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Finally something out of the box not from a series
dSBsNeYqh-k,He just went to the store to get some milk
dSBsNeYqh-k,Lol all these fake ass accounts trying to make it look like this isn't a bland-ass trailer that stole the name from a classic novel and film that it has very little in common with besides having an invisible man in the story
dSBsNeYqh-k,Did I just watch the whole movie in 2 minutes?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Let's see 
Nude scene ‚úî
Swearing ‚úî
Battered Woman ‚úî
Terrible Monster Design ‚úî
Lazy Writing ‚úî
Well all signs show a shity film in the making."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This looks more like 'Hollow Man' than the original 'Invisible Man' by James Whale. They somehow managed to screw up another 'Universal Monsters' character. This is such a disappointment, again."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Well, I just saw the entire movie in this trailer, thanks"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Im pretty sure this is a Marvel Drax solo movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,Seems like a good start
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hallow man eh wrong movie üåö
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This looks like shit, I can't believe this video in it's description said that Jason Blum is a master of horror. He is a fucking hack."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I‚Äôve seen...several things that they could‚Äôve saved on the actual viewing in theaters. It looks good, but the guy who‚Äôs presumably her handler is going to get beat/killed and a rude awakening, she‚Äôs going to the psych ward, and that ‚Äúthere you are part‚Äù is probably the climax."
dSBsNeYqh-k,What if the twist is shes the invisible one‚ÄºÔ∏èü§î
dSBsNeYqh-k,Nice spoilers.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Boringgggggg.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Soooo... the Dark Universe is still a thing, huh?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks VERY interesting.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Good movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,Nice movie üëå üëè Thanks for the upload üëç
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks like John Lakeman is actually doing pretty good...
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Great adaptation, congrats. I use to love the old one. Now I'm in love with this one already. üëåüèæ"
dSBsNeYqh-k,is it just me or no-one cares about this movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Me: - Oh what a cool idea! It it really an invisible man? Or is she going craz...
Trailer: - It's an invisible man. Yup. Move along."
dSBsNeYqh-k,This actually looks really good
dSBsNeYqh-k,Kevin Bacon?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hope he has that crazy laugh like the original from the 1930‚Äôs
dSBsNeYqh-k,"some bits remind me of ""candyman"""
dSBsNeYqh-k,"So is this supposed to be set in the same universe as Tom Cruise's Mummy movie, or did they cancel Dark Universe?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Damn, glad they dropped the 'Dark Universe' action horror nonsense and decided to make an actual horror movie."
dSBsNeYqh-k,If Sleeping with the Enemy and Hollow Man had a baby.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"It would've made a fantastic edition to the Dark Universe.
I wanted to see him try to take over Prodigium or constantly be a thorn in the other monster's side.
Couldn't you imagine he and Mr. Hyde meeting eachother?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Thank you for showing me the entire movie, now I don't have to buy a ticket!"

dSBsNeYqh-k,In india we have Mr.X and Mr.India
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Everyone: ""Hey, this looks cool!""
Universal: ""Okay, cue the surprise.""

*DARK UNIVERSE*"
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks actually pretty good but I keep thinking of the invisible man in hotel transylvania and I couldn't take this seriously.
dSBsNeYqh-k,good and cool
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This is going to be great!!!  
The story is different but I thought it was going to be a live action film of the novel by H.G. WELLS"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"‚ÄúThe Invisible Man‚Äù

Me: *thinking of Rocky Horror* but no one saw him!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,I wouldn't be surprised if John Cena is the invisible Man...
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Wow, who green-lit this trailer? It literally gives away the twist, cheers for that"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Wow, so you can‚Äôt tell wether or not he‚Äôs legit invisible or if she‚Äôs completely lost her shit. Interesting."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Men, creo que acabo de ver la pelicula completa en este trailer."

dSBsNeYqh-k,"It's the invisible man , but the trailer shows too fucking much. Nice job spoiling everything"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Wow, i people said the hollow man was awful"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"So... That's Pretty Much the movie, right?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,What is this a Lifetime movie. The Wolfman from 2010 is better.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Oh nice, the whole movie is in the trailer!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,We had this. It was called Hollow Man with Kevin Bacon
dSBsNeYqh-k,I hope he doesn't die in the end but that's exactly what will happen. üòï
dSBsNeYqh-k,hooooo

dSBsNeYqh-k,I would appreciate this trailer more if they hadn't spoiled the whole story.
dSBsNeYqh-k,I remember reading the novel 'the invisible man' in childhood. No Film has ever came close to that.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Oh no an invisible man üòÇüòÇüòÇ
dSBsNeYqh-k,There's no comedy in it? That's disappointing.

dSBsNeYqh-k,SPOILER ALERT...ITS KEVIN BACON!!!! (Hollow Man)
dSBsNeYqh-k,Can't you just carry a bag of flour and throw it around?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Fun fact: Elizabeth Moss did the voice of a little girl called Kimmy in an episode of the Batman animated series back in 1993 where her father played an invisible man villain.
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is absolutely brilliant üëèüëèüëè ~ Can't Wait üôåüé¨
dSBsNeYqh-k,It looks interesting. But I it should've used a different title.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Would you look at that - they dropped the whole ""movie universe"" angle, and made what looks like a good movie."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"as long as Moss doesn't have that dick smirk she always had in The handmaid""s tale this should be good"

dSBsNeYqh-k,"Its really saddens me that the amazing Dracula Untold didnt do better and start the Dark Universe, ive been a huge Universal Classic Monsters since childhood, and a shared universe of those characters would have been mind blowing. This looks interesting but im not that into it after the whole Dark Universe letdown."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Anyone else is going see the ""1933 Version"" of ""the invisible man"" ?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,nicely trailer i likely this video my dear ü§î
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Boy!, they really showed a lot!...üëçüèæ"

dSBsNeYqh-k,"I basically saw the hole movie with this trailer, thank you Universal Pictures!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Invisible dengan hollow apa bezanya?..next
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Bout a minute and a half too long. Still, looks good though"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I feel like he wasn't a sociopath, more like a psychopath"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Holy Crap. You gave the entire movie away in one trailer?! Why would I go now?!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Let this to be a start of Dark Universe, please"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Why turn it into a psychological thriller, why?! Why couldn‚Äôt they keep it into supernatural or suspense, why?!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this going to tie into the Mummy Movie at all and the Dark Universe that Universal pictures wanted to start with Connecting all of them together like Marvel Movies ?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Gayab ho ke sab dikh tha hai Mai jaha bhi rahu copy of Hindi movie GAYAB

dSBsNeYqh-k,"Put it in the 1800th. I'm sick of this ""modern realistic take crap"" on old classics."
dSBsNeYqh-k,From a classic novel to a horror movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,Elizabeth Moss always done a great job playing a crazy person/someone going insane.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Actually, the whole essence of the film is stated in the phrase from the trailer: ""you claim that having such power your ex spends it to drive you crazy?""
Really sounds crazy, it is better to review the film Verhoeven is where invisible from the side effects on the mind and feelings of absolute permissiveness blew mind and he became a maniac.


Hide and speak aloud into the room before attacking the unseen 
man( naked all the kills and hits) which makes no noise ""HERE YOU are""
- she's not crazy , she's stupid"
dSBsNeYqh-k,ah i love this already. Elizabeth Moss is such an amazing actress
dSBsNeYqh-k,...so...a guy finds a way to become invisible...and uses this amazing technology....to scare his ex?  Looks dumb as Hell.  Get out of my office.  Come back when you have something original.
dSBsNeYqh-k,My god man literally can‚Äôt wait üî•
dSBsNeYqh-k,Worst trailer in the history of trailers.
dSBsNeYqh-k,I was expecting HG Well's The Invisible Man but... I'm not disappointed. Looking forward to this movie!
dSBsNeYqh-k,üôÑüôÖüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüëéüèæ
dSBsNeYqh-k,Can you guys let the Universal Monsters rest in peace? These movies somehow are more embarrassing with each one you make.
dSBsNeYqh-k,This movie is going to bomb. The mummy was ass and this will be too. I really hope I‚Äôm wrong though.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"If I don't hear Scatman sing I'm the Invisible Man at some point in this film, then so help me...!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I don‚Äôt know how you‚Äôve managed to turn Wells novel, and the original adaption into such a generic pile of shit, but I think woke culture played it‚Äôs part."
dSBsNeYqh-k,This reminds me of a movie called hollow man!!
dSBsNeYqh-k,Oh come on!! You could have ended this trailer 10 secs ago and let me have the mystery
dSBsNeYqh-k,Where is the joy of original H. G. Wells's Tale?
dSBsNeYqh-k,holy shit this looks good
dSBsNeYqh-k,The invisible spoiler
dSBsNeYqh-k,Who Remembers Hollow Man?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Interesting
dSBsNeYqh-k,Could've casted John Cena...missed a great opportunity.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Ironic that a trailer about not being able to see something keeps showing more and more and more to the point where we‚Äôve actually seen the entire movie without actually ‚Äúseeing‚Äù it

(Takes hit off joint) 

Whoa"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Too bad they gave away something in the trailer that would have been a huge draw for this movie: ""Is she imaging everything, or is he really invisible?""... they literally spoiled that piece of the plot, and who ever made this trailer, should be fired."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Gives me vibes of The Hollowman
dSBsNeYqh-k,So this is not part of the dark universe then?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Wow OK this definitely got my attention. I wasn't sure how they would make this some what creepy or thrilling but I guess they found a way.
dSBsNeYqh-k,I don‚Äôt care if Universal reboots their Monster Pictures. As long as it stays true to the original. This looks really cool. :)
dSBsNeYqh-k,Great! Another movie from Universal to ruin the classic horror monsters once again!!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"It's a copy of indian film.

Mr X https://youtu.be/3RrIw7kgc3s"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Regardless of how scary this movie turns out to be, it‚Äôs got nothing on the  trailer for Cats."
dSBsNeYqh-k,This legitimately gave me chills. I want more.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this the same universe as The Mummy
dSBsNeYqh-k,Thank you Blumhouse for insuring this wasn't another fucking action adventure movie like the failure that was The Mummy.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Please be good, we need a good Universal Monster remake/reboot for once (also a nitpick, why couldn't they just call him Jack Griffin like in the original?)"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Thanks for showing the whole movie universal. Now I know what happens.
dSBsNeYqh-k,para qu√© la voy a ver si ya me contaron todo lo que pasa en el trailer?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This could be the first flop of 2020: Looks (at first sight) like an hybrid between ""Enough"" and ""Hollow Man""."
dSBsNeYqh-k,I mean this looks good but the trailer literally just showed that she ends up in mental hospital
dSBsNeYqh-k,The Hollow Man 3 that we should have gotten.
dSBsNeYqh-k,It‚Äôs called thermal infrared. Get a thermal infrared camera or just get a bucket of paint to see him. It‚Äôs not hard. He‚Äôs just a normal guy who stole Harry Potter‚Äôs invisible cloak.
dSBsNeYqh-k,This movie need support so that studio make dark universe...
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Finally, Elizabeth moss is back."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Another remake...Hollywood is doomedü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è...
dSBsNeYqh-k,I would laugh my ass off if it turns out THIS movie actually succeeded in launching a franchise while Universal's other two attempts didn't.
dSBsNeYqh-k,that looks surprisingly good
dSBsNeYqh-k,THIS-IS-THE-REMAKE-WE'VE-BEEN-WAITING-FOR!
dSBsNeYqh-k,I want to see this like NOW
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow Man
dSBsNeYqh-k,hollow man vibes.
dSBsNeYqh-k,OMG
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Movie looks like B movie trash. So sad, this reboot could of been so much better."
dSBsNeYqh-k,1:26 Jack Nicholson.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Nice of them to show the whole movie in the trailer.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow man part2
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks like Blumhouse garbage. They revealed the WHOLE FUCKING MOVIE
dSBsNeYqh-k,One more movie like this works well money wise like a decent hit and decent critic score? Leigh Whanell is going to become the high concept guy in hollywood.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Holy shit, this looks really cool. No need of secret science projects, or monsters ü§ò"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Its carzy cause I was just watching her recent movie the kitchen and her husband was abusive in that now in this moive he is abusive
dSBsNeYqh-k,"this is second installments Dark  Universe films franchise???? or just a  reboot?  of the 1933¬†film adaptation of the same name.?
this movie is rip off 
Paul Verhoeven Hollow Man 2000 film. what are you thinking???? Universal/Blumhouse"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Thanos: I am inevitable

Adrial: I am invisible

Trump: I am undefeatable

dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this part of the Dark Universe Cinematic Universe that they‚Äôre still trying to make a thing?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks great can‚Äôt wait
dSBsNeYqh-k,This feels like a morbid comedy
dSBsNeYqh-k,"That Invisible Man is about to get Me Too'd

Well, if people are able to take him a photo"
dSBsNeYqh-k,I hope the Invisible man is better than the mummy.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Interesting I likeee
dSBsNeYqh-k,"That's one of those ""see the whole movie"" trailers. Even if I don't know the whole story, I feel like I already do."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"' I'm the invisible 



Incredible how you can




See right through me'"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This movie suppose to follow up Dracula, mummy and now invisible man. Hope they don't make this one disappointing"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this a part of the Dark Universe?
dSBsNeYqh-k,I think the trailer showed too much of the movie.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"https://youtu.be/PFV7MIQgoN4

dSBsNeYqh-k,Thanks for showing us the entire movie.
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks extremely boring...
dSBsNeYqh-k,"A sequel of Hollow Man?
Oh, i see ..."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Didn't know hollow man 2 was coming out next year........
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Imagine Dahlia fighting against the Invisible Man...
*Monster vs Monster*"
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks awesome. Not what I was expecting.
dSBsNeYqh-k,I like the shift in perspective; Hollow Man as experienced from the other side.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This looks like absolute shit.
Fuck Universal."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"You're crazy to know who I am, aren't you? Alright, I'll show you! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,this is what i was hoping for when they announced they're rebooting the classic monsters into a shared universe not an action franchise but a horror franchise. THIS LOOKS AMAZING!!! cant wait to see this
dSBsNeYqh-k,What a trailer üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
dSBsNeYqh-k,This would all be over if she just threw a cup of paint at him when her friends are around
dSBsNeYqh-k,This us part of the dark universe right?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Ooops they messed up and uploaded the whole movie... wonder when the trailer comes out
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow man or invisible man
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Not sure how to feel about this. Looks kind of bland.
Also, wasn't Johnny Depp supposed to be playing The Invisible Man? Isn't this part of the ""Dark Universe"" anymore?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,the whole movie is in the trailer ffs
dSBsNeYqh-k,"WARNING!!!!!!! THE TRAILER TELLS THE WHOLE MOVIE.!! stop at 1:00 and get out

seriosuly trailer... You got me with the first minute...
And then you told me the whole movie. -_-"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Damn...
dSBsNeYqh-k,Finally the dark universe is back to a horror genre and not make it like the mummy
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Well it's definitely taking it more serious than they did with ""The Mummy""! As a huge fan of the original Universal Monsters films, this looks interesting - but it seems like an entirely separate concept. From this trailer I can't see any references to the 1933 film, or the source novel for that matter - apart from the character being invisible/insane. I must admit, I miss the gothic horror side to the originals, like what they did with ""The Wolf Man"" remake in 2010. A company like A24 who have made ""The Lighthouse"" would probably have given us something more close to the source of these films. My hopes aren't set too high, but it's definitely an improvement from the first attempt at the 'Dark Universe' concept."
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks really cheap and low budget
dSBsNeYqh-k,Not bad!!
dSBsNeYqh-k,I have read the noble of the invisible man and that thing is fucked up i even regretted spending money which i very rarely do i case of books but this trailer looks a lot different from the book
dSBsNeYqh-k,this looks great but they showed too much
dSBsNeYqh-k,Baseless Story. üòé
dSBsNeYqh-k,Cool.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Promising
dSBsNeYqh-k,Did I just see the entire movie in this trailer?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Has she never heard of the good old bag of flower technique .
dSBsNeYqh-k,I see now why they wanted Johnny Depp to play the part
dSBsNeYqh-k,Best movie !!!!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Took everything interesting about the Invisible Man, and turned it into yet another one of those GENERIC crazy stalker boyfriend / girlfriend movies...you got to be fucking KIDDING ME Universal.  This movie is going to BOMB so hard!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,John Cena looks awesome in this movie!
dSBsNeYqh-k,How to catch an invisible man: Download a thermal cam app or cover the floors in wet paint.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Looks good just hope he gets the classic wraps,trench coat,and fedora"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Damn, you guys. Managed to turn the warped fantasy of the Invisible Man into a cypher for the toxic, vengeful male Id that women have been combating since time immemorial ‚Äî and outing in recent years. A torch carried for the #MeToo movement. Powerfully done, Leigh and team."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Oh good... I've seen the whole movie. I'm glad I don't have to go to the theater to go see it
dSBsNeYqh-k,Throw paint at him
dSBsNeYqh-k,Why does the trailer shows almost the whole plot?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Ooh this looks good!
dSBsNeYqh-k,I like the approach. But they just gave away the entire plot in the trailer.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Thank god, that the mummy bombed."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this the dark universe?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Elisabeth Moss=Day one
Leigh Whannell=Day one
The total of this movie is officially a Day one."
dSBsNeYqh-k,John Cena out here wildin.
dSBsNeYqh-k,I have this amazing power aaaaand I'm just gonna waste it on some loser cunt..... srsly?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Man this is nothing but a remake of Hollowman
dSBsNeYqh-k,Their you have it folks another trailer that just showed you the movie from beginning to end
dSBsNeYqh-k,Goosebumps
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This is nothing like the HG Wells book or 1933 film of The Invisible Man. Instead of a story about man's reach exceeding his grasp and going mad with power, we have some #MeToo, gaslighting, generic-looking stalker/slasher film. But what did I expect? It is the [CURRENT YEAR] after all."
dSBsNeYqh-k,üò∂
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Huh, why did this look good?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,F this shit. Who the hell is the editor for the trailer? Showed the whole bloody movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,"wow this actually looks good!
I am very surprised. now I'm looking forward to see this!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Sweet guys I just saw the whole movie.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"So this is what happened after Hill House? This is more toxic than Joker though, where's the backlash?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Okey only problem, just one itzy bitsy problem i got to this trailer, its show to much, i didnt needed to see some parts, but damn this movie looks awsome ;D"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Anyone remember hollow man?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"So, wheres the classic bandage outfit, and The Invisible Man doesnt talk in this version?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"It might be an interesting film. But holy damn did the trailer-editor want to convince me of the exact opposite. 

Allthough, it did hit pretty much all of the expected plot points... So I guess I don't have to see the film anyway. Yay?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Looks okay, i'm still hesitant, but mostly just makes me want to watch Hollow Man with Kevin Bacon."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Cool, dont gotta see it now"
dSBsNeYqh-k,So Hollywood is on a spree of remaking old movies ?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Yo Universal, see what happens when you tell the team behind Transformers and Star Wars Trek to fuck off. Now you don't have to worry about China bailing you out of a flop"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks a lot better than I was expecting.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Take a paint and splash on him!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"0:33  Oh, Blumhouse?  Yeah, I'm in."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Interesting idea but I don't think it deserves to have the name of the invisible man .
dSBsNeYqh-k,Great trailer. Love the cast. Looking forward to this picture!
dSBsNeYqh-k,Good to see John Lakeman really found himself after leaving McMillan
dSBsNeYqh-k,I just saw most of the movie in this trailer. No need to go to the movies
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Annnnnd, it looks like they gave away pretty much most of the movie."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Well done. The whole film in 2.5 minutes. That's saved lots money on cinema tickets.
dSBsNeYqh-k,They've showed the whole movie. Fuck off
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I know it.
This is New start of

dSBsNeYqh-k,How is this comment section not 95% John Cena comments? üòÇ
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This is probably just what the doctor ordered.  A modern interpretation of something that is a classic.  Granted, I haven't seen The Invisible Man in a while so I'll rewatch that before watching this just to compare and contrast."
dSBsNeYqh-k,I was expecting the dark universe
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This is not a trailer, this is a summary."
dSBsNeYqh-k,This actually looks good
dSBsNeYqh-k,That's good
dSBsNeYqh-k,YES! It's from the director of UPGRADE.
dSBsNeYqh-k,cool
dSBsNeYqh-k,You just showed me the whole movie....Thanks.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Nice
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Holy fuck, looks intense"
dSBsNeYqh-k,He just invisible not a ghost why u make the trailer look like a typical horror movie lol
dSBsNeYqh-k,0:52 Chocolate Chip Trip by TOOL?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This looks like an interesting take, a more psychological angle"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Universal Horrorverse gone very bad.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Well I just watched the whole movie in this trailer, no need to see it in theaters now."
dSBsNeYqh-k,WHAT DATE DO YALL HAVE UNIVERSAL PICTURES FOR JANUARY 3 2020 from BLUMHOUSE I REALLY WANNA KNOW
dSBsNeYqh-k,f*** this looks good!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I don't have to see the movie now, the trailer revealed everything"
dSBsNeYqh-k,So..... Hollow Man?
dSBsNeYqh-k,STARRING JOHN CENA!
dSBsNeYqh-k,Omg! they revealed whole story
dSBsNeYqh-k,I‚Äôm not letting this off easy. We all know it‚Äôs easy to make a movie about an invisible man.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This is my commentüëá




You can't read it.it's invisible üòé"
dSBsNeYqh-k,the Dark Universe is dead. Universal classic monsters will be made independently now by different directors (Paul Feig etc)
dSBsNeYqh-k,I'd liked this to have been apart of that mummy movie. I really wanted to see were that was going to be honest. Ok they messed it up but they still could have made a really good universe
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks fucking nuts...I'M WATCHING THISü§£
dSBsNeYqh-k,Ok this looks really good. Please do more of this with your Monster characters Universal and let Del Toro make his damn Frankenstein movies he's always wanted to make
dSBsNeYqh-k,"That sucks 
No one would believe you and you'd be hunted around for your life"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"The plot is very interesting, the actress is incredible, I hope this story has a different ending."
dSBsNeYqh-k,This will be better than Iron Man.
dSBsNeYqh-k,It‚Äôs by the same guy who made upgrade so it‚Äôs in good handsüëåüèΩüòÅüòÅüòÅ
dSBsNeYqh-k,From the same dude Who Direct upgrade
dSBsNeYqh-k,Yawn.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Holy Moly.
Take my money already."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks like they listened to RedLetterMedia and made the Dark Universe a series of horror movies instead.
dSBsNeYqh-k,hollow man remake
dSBsNeYqh-k,Im really curious how the fight scene works in this movie....
dSBsNeYqh-k,If this is the start of a Dark Universe Franchises like Having Universal Monsters same word this is the perfect It's Dark and actually Scary like it should be not like The Mummy 2017
dSBsNeYqh-k,I like how they spoiled a lot in the trailer.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow Man meets The Death Eaters
dSBsNeYqh-k,It feels like there was a poltergeist script lying around and someone just took out the ghost and put in the Invisible Man. Not sure how I feel about that.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks great so why did they feel the need to spoil the whole fucking thing in the trailer?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"It's an irony that for an invisible man's trailer, you showed too much üòë"
dSBsNeYqh-k,I thought Dark Universe died after Mummy
dSBsNeYqh-k,Thanks for showing me the whole movie. I don't have to go see it and give you money. I think maybe you intended to let people know what they're getting into by seeing your movie but you did a great job of giving me every plot point and every action scene. Too bad they can't nominate 2 min trailers to the Nickelodeon Kids choice awards.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Johnny should‚Äôve been that sociopathüî•üî•
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is pretty meh. The premise comes off pretty dumb not disturbing. A dude fakes his death to just harass his ex some more.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Imagine supporting this generic, lowest common denominator tier, pandering scam of a movie lmaooooo. You are boring and basic if you‚Äôre looking forwards to this"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Plot twist, he has a twin brother who he kills and make it look like it's him. He makes himself invisible and starts to haunt his ex-wife. 2nd plot twist, she makes herself invisible too and fights back with her new powers."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this supposed to be a new start of a dark universe where they reimagine classic monsters and bring them together for a monster mash movie?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"What a nice summary of the film, now I don't need to go watch it myself"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Wonderful trailer...
dSBsNeYqh-k,"‚ÄúWell, well, well, if it ain‚Äôt the invisible cunt‚Äù lol for real the movie looks good"
dSBsNeYqh-k,one question.. are we just watching a movie just in 2 and half minute?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"OMG all these people hurting themselves, let's just NOT believe her. She's crazy."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Who all studied it in class 10 cbse
dSBsNeYqh-k,You have invisible man...we have tushar Kapoor
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This trailer is revealing everything from beginning to end, telling from who gonna die to how she‚Äôll fight back against her ex boyfriend. Seriously studios need to stop revealing the whole movie and just gives us a few glimpses like a normal trailer should."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollowman
dSBsNeYqh-k,Yawn ü•±
dSBsNeYqh-k,The only invisible man is john cena u cant see him
dSBsNeYqh-k,Where‚Äôs the trench coat?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Why on EARTH would you show that Aldis Hodge gets all bloodied up?
dSBsNeYqh-k,THIS LOOKS VERY PROMISING! I can‚Äôt wait to see this!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Invisible Man is for Kids
Hollowman    is for Men"
dSBsNeYqh-k,You can't see me üëÄ
dSBsNeYqh-k,There's some unsettling shit going on with the camera
dSBsNeYqh-k,üòÆüò±
dSBsNeYqh-k,I'm kind of disappointed that Queen's The Invisible Man didn't play during the trailer
dSBsNeYqh-k,Invisible Man with a female lead? Nah
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks genuinely unnerving. I absolutely love it. Upgrade was such a gem and this film looks like it could be even better. Definitely one of my most anticipated movies for next year. Leigh Whannell is a real talent.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Shouldve named the dude T.i.m., The invisible man."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Now that's a movie i would like to see.
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks very VERY interesting
dSBsNeYqh-k,thanks for telling us all the fkng movie!!
dSBsNeYqh-k,"""There you are!"" *stab* (and might be the climax/ending of the movie)"
dSBsNeYqh-k,The original Invisible Man is one of the best classic horror films. Hope Leigh‚Äôs film holds up!
dSBsNeYqh-k,Buy spray paint and a gun!
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this set in the Dark Universe?
dSBsNeYqh-k,I think johnny depp is the best as invisible man
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This looks good, but damn Universal... Why did you show the whole movie in the trailer?"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Just a reminder that he's naked.

Have fun rewatching the trailer now."
dSBsNeYqh-k,‚ù§üëåüèªüëçüèª
dSBsNeYqh-k,Wish this was connected to the mummy
dSBsNeYqh-k,Nice. Glad I saw this free movie.
dSBsNeYqh-k,I don't see anyone ?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Xvideos?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"1) You just showed the whole movie basically.
2) Elizabeth Moss.... gross
3) You gain powers of invisibility and you chose to torture your ex with it? Some genius."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this still part of the Dark Universe?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hollow Man went overboard. I hope this  reboot of Well's novel stick to the book
dSBsNeYqh-k,I'll Show You who I am!
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is the true invincible man...
dSBsNeYqh-k,Oliver is already so good in this trailer I wonder what will happen in the movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Dont let me down again, Universal. Cant wait for the Bride of Frankie movie too."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this new reboot from Hollow man?
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks good.
dSBsNeYqh-k,looks good
dSBsNeYqh-k,WARNING NOT TO WATCH THIS TRAILER. A lot of spoilers on the second part of the trailer
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks kinda generic
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Turning the extraordinary into ordinary to make it relatable doesn't always works, that sometimes kills the mythical air, and turns the subject into something simply banal. I hope this isn't the case."
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks great! It kind of reminds me of the original Candyman movie how you don't know if there really is an unseen boogeyman or if she's just crazy.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Show yourself! and then my wife said ""I hope he don't show his Bacon, like Kevin did in Hollowman, cuz he's creepy looking!"""
dSBsNeYqh-k,Even the moon is frightened of me!
dSBsNeYqh-k,Universal is Bringing back The Dark Universe.
dSBsNeYqh-k,And yes it's promising.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This movie could be Glass' sequel,
new superpower discovered. Invisible !üòÜ"
dSBsNeYqh-k,I was gonna say is this a horror but I think this is a thriller
dSBsNeYqh-k,The Invisible Man Is In Aspect Ratio Screen:2.35:1 üôÇüôÇ
dSBsNeYqh-k,STUPID !  And some of you are going to settle for this Pablum ... Geeeez !
dSBsNeYqh-k,I'm shocked. This doesnt look like utter dogshit!
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks good. Too bad my hopes for an interconnected Dark Universe of all the characters has been dashed.
dSBsNeYqh-k,These new horror movies all have the same style. It‚Äôs annoying
dSBsNeYqh-k,They kinda gave the movie away at the end...didn't need to show how she's fighting back and seeing him and everything....looked good 3/4 through already...now I feel like I know how it will end...
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Bro! I was researching this movie a week ago, and had next to nothing about it! And today comes a trailer out of nowhere! I was expecting this movie too much!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,I gotta admit...this remake of the invisible man looks pretty fucking amazing. I cant wait to relive my childhood
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I feel like whenever a trailer shows too much, it's like the studio doesn't trust in the movie to succeed. Just have it short without revealing so much. But are they going to do that? no, they're going to release three more trailers."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Griffin is that you?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Literally just showed the whole movie!
dSBsNeYqh-k,PSA: Stop watching at 2:00
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks real good actually
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This actually looks like a good remake of a classic horror. Makes it appeal to modern audiences, while keeping the same idea of the original."
dSBsNeYqh-k,Small Youtuber Here!
dSBsNeYqh-k,This looks quite good.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Oy to the vey.
dSBsNeYqh-k,R RATED Dark Universe??? Seem like a better idea to me!!! So its back on track possibly
dSBsNeYqh-k,Oh boy I thought this was a Dark Universe sequel
dSBsNeYqh-k,I thought it was based on hg wells' novel
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Normally, I would be looking forward to a live representation of the novel, but this looks amazing!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is dumb. Just get thermal googles or whatever.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Don't fuck this one up like with Mummy
dSBsNeYqh-k,The greatest one
dSBsNeYqh-k,Now atleast this is a movie üò©
dSBsNeYqh-k,"wheres russel and tom?
The mummy is the best"
dSBsNeYqh-k,The invisible man is so cool üòé I  wish I can Turn invisible with powers
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks like dark universe just got yeeted
dSBsNeYqh-k,Dark Universe Movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Looks really good I am actually excited to see this.

Like if you are going to see this or like for just the heck of it"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Do I wrongly remember that this movie is supposed to take place in The Dark Universe (which supposedly started as a movie series from The Mummy 2017)
dSBsNeYqh-k,Be happy its not PG13 shit...lets enjoy
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Wonder if this could be the start of the Dark Universe. I was actually interested in it after I watched The Mummy, not as bad as many people make it out to be."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"I like it when movies take a new turn on their source material, but it looks like they didn‚Äôt look at anything about the invisible man before making this movie at all."
dSBsNeYqh-k,the whole movie is in this trailer! are u kidding me?
dSBsNeYqh-k,"_""I never blame anyone. It's quite out of fashion.""_

*~ H.G. Wells (The Invisible Man)*"
dSBsNeYqh-k,ELISABETH FUCKING MOSS
dSBsNeYqh-k,Any fans of HOLLOW MAN here???? I enjoyed that one
dSBsNeYqh-k,"""You're CRAZY to know who I am, don't you? All right. I'll SHOW YOU!!!!"" I loved the 1933 film. I can't wait to see how this remake will compare to the original!!!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Universal Pictures: You didn't see that coming?.jpg
dSBsNeYqh-k,*i thing brad pitt is a invisible manü§£ü§£*
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Is this the new Dark Universe movie?
God damn, this looks generic as hell. Just like every modern day ""horror"" film. A series of jump-scares with a loose plot. If this is the direction of the ""Dark Universe"" now, then it's even worse than Mummy 2017."
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is scarier than Hollow Man.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Elizabeth üôåüôåüôåüôåüôåüôåüôåüôå‚ù§
dSBsNeYqh-k,Almost a movie with fast cuts
dSBsNeYqh-k,More and more R RATED films please!!!!
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is this part of the dark universe or not? I don't know it looks really good
dSBsNeYqh-k,I'm really hoping the big twist is that she's actually mentally insane lmao
dSBsNeYqh-k,This is the Invisible Man that we deserve in a way that the Dark Universe needs. Please let it be great! üôè
dSBsNeYqh-k,It's incredible how trailers now become spoilers
dSBsNeYqh-k,Hindi dubbed?
dSBsNeYqh-k,John Cena Biopic?!?
dSBsNeYqh-k,I'm at least intrigued.
dSBsNeYqh-k,I know this will get lost in the comment section.. But I really enjoy fisting my nipples.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Imagine while they are acting,the actors are just talking to the air while making this film ,im really curious how the fight scenes work.......lol"
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Is he translucent?üòÇ
The boys would blow him up from ass upüòÇüî•"
dSBsNeYqh-k,It's Going to be blockbuster Thriller Movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,Remember when this was originally part of the short-lived Dark Universe?
dSBsNeYqh-k,Interesting..... üòÆüòÆüòÆüòÆ
dSBsNeYqh-k,The invisible sociopath man
dSBsNeYqh-k,The Dark Universe take 2.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Wow thanks for ruining a classic
dSBsNeYqh-k,It's hollow man
dSBsNeYqh-k,Is it in the universe of the mummy
dSBsNeYqh-k,"So hollow man, not gonna lie it looks good"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Looks decent
dSBsNeYqh-k,The invisible man will get the Dark Universe back on track.
dSBsNeYqh-k,Awsome Movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,Elizabeth moss is the reason I am here
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Ok... wow... I'll give them credit, this actually looks interesting"
dSBsNeYqh-k,R RATED???? wow yesssssss
dSBsNeYqh-k,"Wow, thanks for letting me watch the whole movie for free Universal!"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Pretty cool update of a classic tho.
dSBsNeYqh-k,I remember when Johnny Depp was supposed to play the Invisible Man
dSBsNeYqh-k,Where's the Invisible Man I can't see him??
dSBsNeYqh-k,‚úåü§ì
dSBsNeYqh-k,"This does look interesting. Much better than that Mummy Reboot with Tom Cruise, in my opinion.
More Psychological and Terrifying. Emphasis. ON. Terrifying."
dSBsNeYqh-k,"No, I'm over here, dear"
dSBsNeYqh-k,Thanks. Just watched the whole movie
dSBsNeYqh-k,Finally! Sh*t. Been waiting for this movie for what seems like forever.
dSBsNeYqh-k,"You Can't see me

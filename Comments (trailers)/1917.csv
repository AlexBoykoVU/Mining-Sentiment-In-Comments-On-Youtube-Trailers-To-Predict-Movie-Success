YqNYrYUiMfg,Is this our answer to All quiet on the Western front.
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Who saw this movie, was it actually good?"
YqNYrYUiMfg,hello there good movie
YqNYrYUiMfg,Wait!  Where is Dogmeat?
YqNYrYUiMfg,Why‚Äôs Ben Shapiro in WW1???
YqNYrYUiMfg,Narnia's gotten weird
YqNYrYUiMfg,Still can't get over the fact that Sherlock and Moriarty  are in the same movie. Is this Passchendaele?
YqNYrYUiMfg,FSK?
YqNYrYUiMfg,Sanitater!! Sanitater!!!
YqNYrYUiMfg,"After watching the long shot in Atonement, I‚Äôm surprised it took so long for someone to come up with making an entire world war movie like Birdman in one shot"
YqNYrYUiMfg,Can they release the version of this song in the trailer
YqNYrYUiMfg,"I'm confused, the release date for the film says december 25th and yet on the day and 2 days after it was suppost to come out I've looked up theatres near me to small and big cities and no theatres are showing this movie, is It only being shown in Europe at the moment? If that's the case when will it come to the u.s.?"
YqNYrYUiMfg,WWI/WWII=Time to buy tickets
YqNYrYUiMfg,Watched it..... Masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
YqNYrYUiMfg,0:18 is it just me or does he sound like the British officer from Trench 11?
YqNYrYUiMfg,2917
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Revolutionary Road, Road to Perdition and American Beauty were melodramatic tripe. I don't see much hope for war film genre in Mendes. His best audiences are first gen immigrants. Everyone else's sensibilities are ignored by Hollywood."
YqNYrYUiMfg,"One of the best war movies I've ever seen, go find a theater showing it and go see it asap"
YqNYrYUiMfg,This is world war 1
YqNYrYUiMfg,I love when people say this looks like Battlefield 1.
YqNYrYUiMfg,I the trailer is amazing imagine the actual movie
YqNYrYUiMfg,Maybe Sam Mendes can make that Harlem Hellfighters movie! Those boys deserve to have their heroism and triumph over bigotry displayed on the big screen too.
YqNYrYUiMfg,WW1 WW2 I think are the best wars for movies
YqNYrYUiMfg,"What pisses me off is that in Virginia, they aren‚Äôt playing this film until late January, and instead of screening this they show, ‚Äúspies in disguise‚Äù and ‚Äúcats‚Äù ü§Æüòí"
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Girls in the locker: OMG can't wait to see Star Wars
Boys: 1917 üòé"
YqNYrYUiMfg,The cinematography in here üëÄ is breathtaking üëçüèæ the lighting üëåüèæ this should win something ü§®
YqNYrYUiMfg,Im thinking this is ww2
YqNYrYUiMfg,When does this actually come out? Because I checked my local theaters and it isn‚Äôt playing anywhere
YqNYrYUiMfg,"please tell me timothee is playing his brother again, that‚Äôd be too goodüòÇ"
YqNYrYUiMfg,‚ÄúThe enemy is being reinforced with an airship‚Äù
YqNYrYUiMfg,Wow
YqNYrYUiMfg,This movie‚Äôs like Dunkirk but 10x better IMO. The cinematography does a much better job of immersing you in the experience and the soundtrack‚Äôs insanely good too. Definitely a movie to watch in theaters
YqNYrYUiMfg,so Tommen Baratheon & Robb Stark are brothers
YqNYrYUiMfg,"I‚Äôm so angry. I was hyped up to go see this on Christmas Day. I logged into the AMC app on Christmas Eve to reserve my tickets for the next day and nothing came up in my city... At first I had hoped that AMC was just late in posting the showtimes for Dec 25th but I just found out today that I need to wait until Jan 10th for a global release!! üò§üò§ 
Anyone near Chicago Ridge/Ford City want to watch it with me? üòÉ I‚Äôm down with meeting new people."
YqNYrYUiMfg,It is not in theatres!
YqNYrYUiMfg,"How smart and orderly are the sandbags stcked, no mud or waterlogged trenches, no duckboards, wow, how clean it looks! A FUCKING JOKE. Fuck this Hollywood shit."
YqNYrYUiMfg,"thought it was not, but this has all the bio-marker of a CanadianFilm Board crap who made movies  like Passchendaele, or Canadian geese in the hinterland ...need I go on as a taxpayer !!  platitude is one thing but if is as flat as a mal-nourrished,  pre-puberty female, I rather be water-boarded than to sit it through."
YqNYrYUiMfg,When is it coming in theaters someone replie to me pleasr
YqNYrYUiMfg,I cant wait to watch this!!!!
YqNYrYUiMfg,At 1:27 it looks like they forgot something. if you look at the sky it looks like the VFX studio removed the green/blue screen or its the walls of the set. it just looks unnatural. and then you have light shining on the buildings and it looks strange and not finished.
YqNYrYUiMfg,Meh when does guardians 3 come out
YqNYrYUiMfg,Is this one where you get really attached to the 2 protagonist and ones dies 3/4 the way through and the other one completes the mission
YqNYrYUiMfg,Wilfred Owen will be proud to see this movie...
YqNYrYUiMfg,1:26 Kermit sings
YqNYrYUiMfg,A Fantastic Movie Covered 1917 At The Premiere Unbelievable It Makes You Feel Like You Are Running Right Beside Him A Must See Well Done
YqNYrYUiMfg,613489_-----(85792414
YqNYrYUiMfg,Where‚Äôs the In Engine watermark at the bottom?
YqNYrYUiMfg,Hay a battlefield 1 movie
YqNYrYUiMfg,Ww1 is my best movie
YqNYrYUiMfg,If this film successfully pulls off what it's trying to pull off then it'll be discussed by cinema studies professors for decades.
YqNYrYUiMfg,Anything world war automatically is in my must watch list
YqNYrYUiMfg,Almost didn‚Äôt recognize Tommen Baratheon!!
YqNYrYUiMfg,Looks too pretty for a ww1 film...
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Oscar
Oscar
Oscar, the next."
YqNYrYUiMfg,"I'm irish and I love history but does no one ever talk about the brave 300,000 Irishmen who served in the trenches during ww1, it may not have seem like a lot off men but when you think about it, Ireland aren't known for fighting in big wars, those brave Irishmen will always hopefully be remembered, even if they were seen as cowards by there own people back home."
YqNYrYUiMfg,I like how racist this movie is and don't include any African American characters in it at all
YqNYrYUiMfg,"This looks so good, I love a classic war movie...I can't wait to see who wins"
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Looks nice but I really wish we could see more WWI and WWII movies seen from a German perspective. In particular with WWII the German experience was profoundly different from the British. What we think of as typical WWI with totally incompetent commanders sending sending hordes of people into machine gun fire and really muddy trenches, but this was primarily the British experience.

Germans e.g. had far better built trenches with sleeping quarters. They also used experienced commanders who advanced in the ranks not inexperienced upperclass morons to lead the troops.

But for Germany the psychology was quite different. It developed into a deeply unpopular war which people no longer wanted. German soldiers also have significant problems with low food rations and low morale towards the end.

I think all of these perspective could have made for a really interesting WWI movie."
YqNYrYUiMfg,If your not an American your not a good soldier
YqNYrYUiMfg,Thought it comes out no theater in my state playing it
YqNYrYUiMfg,I‚Äôve watched the trailer multiple times and that siren at 0:22 gives me chills every time
YqNYrYUiMfg,"""...But the reality of shaving in the trenches of World War 1 was much more difficult than you can imagine. Many soldiers initially carried razors as part of their standard kit. However the wet and muddy conditions of the Western Front meant that they soon became rusty and unusable. The lack of sharpening stones or strops also meant that razor blades became blunt quickly. By 1915 razors became scare on the front lines. There are records and letters from front line soldiers requesting socks, chocolates and razors from their loved ones back home."""
YqNYrYUiMfg,"All sorts of Oscar buzz on THIS one.   Here it is Christmas day, and I was looking online to see where it would be opening in Reno.    At first glance, I see it'll be playing in one theater somewhere downtown......but meanwhile, the BIG multi-screen theaters are committed to plastering MOST of their screens with that Star Wars POS.     And Cats.     I wonder how many chains are locked into contracts, where they HAVE to carry those other films.....and for how long.     I'm sure some fast-food franchise paid big money to have images from those other films all over their cups, etc.    LOL."
YqNYrYUiMfg,It would be nice if we could watch it on Christmas Day. Why the limited release crap? Star wars sucks. I mean don‚Äôt advertise it heavily for Christmas if I can‚Äôt even see it in TX
YqNYrYUiMfg,I just got a ww1 costume for Christmas
YqNYrYUiMfg,The name of this movie is big birds kill count
YqNYrYUiMfg,"*SUFFERED HEAVY LOSSES, THROUGH THE GREAT WAR THEY STOOD STRONG, BUT THE MEMORY OF THE FALLEN STILL LIVES ON!*"
YqNYrYUiMfg,Something tear jerking like this is coming out while movies like Cats are allowed to be in theaters.
YqNYrYUiMfg,Not a single German in the trailer.
YqNYrYUiMfg,I'm so glad to see a WWI movie. It's kind of like Saving Private Ryan for the British.
YqNYrYUiMfg,"So saving private Ryan, 2019 version."
YqNYrYUiMfg,Lord of the Rings (Official parody)
YqNYrYUiMfg,"I was there.  I killed 20,000 Germans"
YqNYrYUiMfg,What year is universal! Make up your mind!
YqNYrYUiMfg,Trailer much better than the movie
YqNYrYUiMfg,Anyone from India
YqNYrYUiMfg,This legit looks like a youtuber movie
YqNYrYUiMfg,"And to think, our government shits on lives lost truly like this with their left wing ideology, our targeted individual ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù is a lie made up by us here normal people! I wish we would wake up to what our government is up to. Make me feel like justice is alive and well here in America."
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Greatest movie to be!! 
Very interesting"
YqNYrYUiMfg,The tank hunter set made me stick to Battlefield 1.
YqNYrYUiMfg,0:11 Love that Shawshank Redemption reference!
YqNYrYUiMfg,Nice video üëç
YqNYrYUiMfg,Does anyone know what year 1917 takes place in?
YqNYrYUiMfg,Do germans win at the end?
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Good, but i also want to see more from the german side"
YqNYrYUiMfg,There was a lot of WW2 films this decade. I'm just happy they made one about WW1 since it's been 100 years since it happened.
YqNYrYUiMfg,Yes Americans we did do something in the war üò§üôÑ
YqNYrYUiMfg,Meanwhile we have everyone trying to tell us to go see some wack ass marvel movie or some pc Disney movie.
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Why are Wwi films always about Germany being the main enemy, but not Austria-Hungary or the Ottoman Empire?"
YqNYrYUiMfg,This looks incredible..
YqNYrYUiMfg,This Movie Is Bringing Back BF1 To Life
YqNYrYUiMfg,I've seen this before it's called Gallipoli
YqNYrYUiMfg,Yes because the British were so brave üòí Just ask France who the biggest cowards were
YqNYrYUiMfg,Looks like Lord of the Rings.
YqNYrYUiMfg,"I am sooooo psyched for this movie. I‚Äôve always felt the great WW1 movie has yet to be made. There‚Äôve been a few good ones, Gallipoli comes to mind, but nothing that captures the horror I have felt when reading about itt. WW2 has always been the focus of good war flicks. This looks very promising."
YqNYrYUiMfg,Sterile video game nonsense. And anyone even remotely familiar with WWI knows all those chaps running that close to artillery impacts would be shredded. The tench assault in 1930‚Äôs ‚ÄúAll Quiet on the Western Front‚Äù is infinitely more brutally artful. And who names a movie ‚Äú1917‚Äù? I have more imagination in my little toe
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Definitely about the American ""doughboys"" in their major offensive against the Germans in France during the last year of the First World War (1914-1918)...1917, the year that we lived dangerously by bravely entering the War...This film is told through the eyes, however, of a certain British regiment."
YqNYrYUiMfg,It isn't even being shown in my area :( This is a movie I want to watch not Ruse of Soywalker.
YqNYrYUiMfg,"""We will lose 1600 men""

A litteral drop in the ocean of blood in this war..."
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Got to see this in an early screening, fantastic movie. I felt like it really captured it well."
YqNYrYUiMfg,I‚Äôve always felt world war 1 is the forgotten war in movies. Glad to see one about it
YqNYrYUiMfg,comment which you like better. saving private ryan or 1917
YqNYrYUiMfg,The fact that this movie is shot in one take is sooo cool! Can't wait
YqNYrYUiMfg,Tommen baratheon and Discount Karl tanner of gin alley
YqNYrYUiMfg,Should sent Forest Gump. He gets it done by no time üòÇ
YqNYrYUiMfg,Shades of Gallipoli in 1915
YqNYrYUiMfg,Is this when we fought the aliens üëΩüëæ
YqNYrYUiMfg,Save your Star Wars money for this.
YqNYrYUiMfg,masterclass in film making !
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Gosh this looks so horrible, whats wrong with cheap shitty ass film makers today. I need to get my ass in there and make a real movie"
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Damn, Benedict just can't catch a break with these World War flicks, huh"
YqNYrYUiMfg,I‚Äôm researching my family tree in the First World War.  I know of a cousin and great uncle who served in the American Expeditionary Force and I suspect I‚Äôll find family in the German army.  It‚Äôs remarkable seeing a revived interest in the Great War nowadays.
YqNYrYUiMfg,One continuous shoot üòÜ
YqNYrYUiMfg,Ok fine I'll watch this.......
YqNYrYUiMfg,all I see is Sherlock Holmes and Jim Moriarty in same movie
YqNYrYUiMfg,Germany had inflicted a lot of pain on the rest of Europe. Thanks god we can all forgive and move on.
YqNYrYUiMfg,When modders have more creativity than actual game devs real sad
YqNYrYUiMfg,DswPlease hey Jaoko me oh my God Taty I don‚Äôt know if I can find you doing why does Santa have called mad about that I don‚Äôt know about that Nancy killed with your daddy magic kit
YqNYrYUiMfg,Juneau county jail pigs
YqNYrYUiMfg,I just got a stroke reading the title
YqNYrYUiMfg,For a second I thought this was a trailer for battlefield or CoD.
YqNYrYUiMfg,So this is pretty much Saving Private Ryan ww1 version.
YqNYrYUiMfg,"My favorite ww1 movie is 1966 the blue max, it had amazing aerial scenes with real biplanes"
YqNYrYUiMfg,I thought ww1 ended 1914
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Not many ww1 movies made so far, this will be a nice addition, kudos to director Sam mendes who did the James bond movies skyfall and spectre"
YqNYrYUiMfg,God this trailer alone is better than most films these days.
YqNYrYUiMfg,1917 did a small budget for the production
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Me: watches the trailer in public 

Random guy on the bus: isn't this the film Joey tribbiani stared in...?
üòÇ"
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Looks awesome, anything to do with 1st and 2nd World Wars grabs my interest straight away and with Sam Mendes directing it‚Äôs a winner"
YqNYrYUiMfg,If only Motorola was found earlier
YqNYrYUiMfg,"One of my favorite trailers ever, the ending really gives me goosebumps. I love it."
YqNYrYUiMfg,Saving Ryans Privates?
YqNYrYUiMfg,Literally haven‚Äôt stopped watching this and probably will continue even after watching the movie because it gives me chills every single time!!!
YqNYrYUiMfg,I find it funny to believe that 1600 men mattered to the British in WWI.
YqNYrYUiMfg,1917 is the December WIN for Universal.
YqNYrYUiMfg,‚ÄúAn enemy behemoth is en route‚Äù
YqNYrYUiMfg,We have lost objective Apples üçé
YqNYrYUiMfg,Holy shit that looks good. I also love war history so I NEED to see this!
YqNYrYUiMfg,I hope this movie delivers. I was kinda disappointed in Dunkirk.
YqNYrYUiMfg,I really like the song but i don't know the kname
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Oh damn, not public in my country"
YqNYrYUiMfg,Never thought I'd see Tommen on the battlefield.
YqNYrYUiMfg,what‚Äôs that song near the end
YqNYrYUiMfg,Is this the Finnish war?
YqNYrYUiMfg,Looks like a ver goid movie
YqNYrYUiMfg,"It looks like a ""Gallipoli"" remake but with English and German's."
YqNYrYUiMfg,Looks like a gr8 movie... Loved Passchendaele... War Horse.. The Lost Battalion... It always amazed me that ...During WW1 the Nazi scumbags always complained about the British allies and their trench gun while they were using Mustard gas & others
YqNYrYUiMfg,"""It will be a massacre...1,600 men"" where has that dude been for the past 3 years"
YqNYrYUiMfg,Guys .... Do you also feel the mustard?
YqNYrYUiMfg,Songs giving me bfv vibes
YqNYrYUiMfg,Does the movie discuss how the Rothschild family funded both sides of the war?
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Looking forward to watch this.....
trailer is so good.."
YqNYrYUiMfg,1:28 where's the sky
YqNYrYUiMfg,"The Titanic and the great war, what a decade"
YqNYrYUiMfg,Operation human shield
YqNYrYUiMfg,1:28 sky placement fail
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Why the story so modern,"
YqNYrYUiMfg,"100 million budget , 1 Billion WORLDWIDE
Vs. CATS ( smh) 95 million budget , a total flop.  Great cinematography and riveting stories make money , not some warmed-over bowl of crap."
YqNYrYUiMfg,"*Doctor Strange in 2018* : _There was no other way_

*Doctor Strange travels back to 1917* : _There is only one way this ends_"
YqNYrYUiMfg,I need to see it ü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§
YqNYrYUiMfg,"I saw an early screening of this movie in LA. Trailer is good but does little justice to how amazing this movie was to watch from start to finish. Everyone should watch it in theaters and be taken in. Never seen a war movie done like this and all credit to director Sam Mendes, the legendary DP Roger Deakins, and the production for making it work like a one-shot."
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Back when Engliand was 99% NATIVE white.  THese men they pretend to honour wouldnt recognise England of today..they fight against it becoming that.  London is a capitol they wouldnt know.  A place that inhaled other nations sons and cultures where acid attacks number in the hundred last year alone.  WHere you cant even call yourself proudly NATIVE BRITAIN without some marxists shouting you down and fining you for hate.   THATS what these 2 wars were for?  Sorry,  they are fallen nations.  Not worth remembering."
YqNYrYUiMfg,Dunkirk vibe
YqNYrYUiMfg,"As a history nerd, my body is ready"
YqNYrYUiMfg,I think this may become one of the biggest and most classic war movies of all time.
YqNYrYUiMfg,Is it going to be Stalingrad quality?
YqNYrYUiMfg,This is still the best trailer I've ever seen
YqNYrYUiMfg,Dunkirk effect.
YqNYrYUiMfg,"This is the movie I've been waiting for Sam Mendes to make in a very long time, I'll forgive him for Spectre"
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Oo you are so sweat movie about stopping the charge of young englismen.
To save their poor souls what a peace of shit.
Is goverment planning another w war and apealing to men brains to enlist.
Let me remind us what peace of shit was this goverment that drafted boys younger than 16 years of age and let me remind how many young man have charged acros nomans land numerous times while oficers were eating fine food and drinking wine .
Fuck this kind of movies i am not going to be killed for no country."
YqNYrYUiMfg,This comment section are full by Battlefield references
YqNYrYUiMfg,This trailer is more scary then a nicemare on lincoln street
YqNYrYUiMfg,I dont think this movie will be in theatres in my country :(
YqNYrYUiMfg,Benedict looks so coool in this!
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Sam Mendes: shoots a movie
Me: grab my fucking money"
YqNYrYUiMfg,ÏßÄÏò•Ïùò Ï∞∏Ìò∏Ï†Ñ Î≥¥ÎäîÍ±¥Í∞ÄÏöî...? ÌïúÍµ≠ Í∞úÎ¥âÏùÄ...?
YqNYrYUiMfg,This looks great.
YqNYrYUiMfg,Who sang the song?
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Oh great, another movie about people with lives, loves and families becoming cannon fodder.  Yippee."
YqNYrYUiMfg,"I saw ""1917"" and thought ""Bolsheviks""!"
YqNYrYUiMfg,looks better than Dunkirk
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Got to see an early release yesterday at a Regal Theatre. This is by far the best cinematic visual masterpiece made this year, and its honestly the best war movie I have ever seen. If your questioning whether to see it in Theatres or not, go see it in Theatres, it was MADE for a big screen and dear G-d the pay off of the camera technique is unbelievable. One continuous shot, makes you truly feel like you are there beside them."
YqNYrYUiMfg,Looks great
YqNYrYUiMfg,"You guys diss the music, but just you wait, it‚Äôs way more appropriate when it‚Äôs sung in the movie."
YqNYrYUiMfg,Why couldn't that just text those 1600 troops
YqNYrYUiMfg,It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre just trying to make a good movie and not trying to please every demographic. Makes me want to see it.
YqNYrYUiMfg,"I showed this trailer to my mom begging her to take me to the movies and watch it and with a concerned look on her face she said
""You're your father's child...."""
YqNYrYUiMfg,Moves looks so totally awesome & REAL. Can't wait 2 C it.  Think it will show despite excitement that war truly IS HELL.
YqNYrYUiMfg,They were better people than we are today.
YqNYrYUiMfg,I swear I‚Äôm a sucker for war movies
YqNYrYUiMfg,Look like cheaper version of saving private Ryan..
YqNYrYUiMfg,I hope the people who make this movie make a world war 2 movie titled 1944 or something
YqNYrYUiMfg,‚ÄúEnemies contesting Charlie!‚Äù
YqNYrYUiMfg,I am hype for Saving Private Ryan: Great War.
YqNYrYUiMfg,"1,600 men, a massacre? Try 19,000+ dead at the Somme in a morning (my great-grandfather wounded). The British high command wouldn't have given a toss about 1,600 men, especially palls battalions from working class towns."
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Anyone else think that Stings ""Children's Crusade"" would be the perfect theme song for this movie?"
YqNYrYUiMfg,Man this movie like its about to be amazing
YqNYrYUiMfg,I‚Äôm not gone lie.. the last 15 seconds of him running through those land mines/ grenades is so powerful. Makes me wanna see the movie now
YqNYrYUiMfg,"I will go see this and hope it is good, without too many tedious stereotypes , although, on the face of it, I have a serious  potential problem with believing a British Army senior officer only having one way to get a message to units under his command in 1917, by which time the British Army was a rather sophisticated organisation (one of my great grandfathers lost his leg that year in battle on the Western Front). 

It has been a long time since a really good British war film was made, the last I saw was 'Kajaki' ('Kilo Two Bravo' in the USA) from 2014 and that only really got made at all because the enemy were inanimate mines, rather than other humans. Nothing from the extraordinary Falkland's campaign from 1982, almost nothing from a hundred gallant actions in Afghanistan.  But then, of course, way over 95% of the British Army are straight white men. 

My Company Commander in the mid 1980's, a man steeped in British Army history and ethos, used to say ""f...king good show chaps, f...king good show,"" when we did well and he was genuinely loved by his men, who knew his company of our regiment was the centre of his life. He seldom asked anyone to do anything he did not do and, if it was dangerous, he was in front and saying ""follow me"". That is a real British officer."
YqNYrYUiMfg,lol i was hping to see Lenin and a young Stalin and Trotsky here but o guessed its on the Western Front.
YqNYrYUiMfg,Ok yea the movie looks awesome and all but wuts the name of the song played at 1:25? I *NEED* to know!
YqNYrYUiMfg,"What an uplifting holiday movie! Great for the grandkids, fun for the whole family! Destined to become the top holiday action film of years to come, second only to the beloved Christmas classic ""Die Hard""."
YqNYrYUiMfg,Honestly this music toward the end ruined the trailer for me
YqNYrYUiMfg,"the 3D effect ending mesh with the title of the movie at the end of the trailer gave me goosebumps in the theater. Great trailer. Can't wait to see the film,"
YqNYrYUiMfg,So it's basically Lord Of The Rings set in WWI.
YqNYrYUiMfg,"only 1600 men? That's not terrible, well compared to the 116,516 american deaths in less then a few months
or the 420,000 British casualties of the battle of the somme
So by ww1 standards not an insane loss, this was the war that depleted everyone's manpower to the point that it created the small squad combat used in ww2"
YqNYrYUiMfg,"To me, the skies should be a hint darker, and a little less green with more smoke.
But Bloody awesome!"
YqNYrYUiMfg,God I hope Dice doesn't ruin the TTK before this drops... o wait
YqNYrYUiMfg,Fantastic. Can't wait to see the movie
YqNYrYUiMfg,at first I thought that was about Russian revolution
YqNYrYUiMfg,"You know the camera and sound guys followed these guys for hours to shoot this entire movie in 1 continuous scene. Brilliant. New movie standard shoot the entire thing in 1 take through 1 continuous scene. First it was the blair witch style now this, awesome!"
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Has anybody ever read the book ""a message to Garcia?"""
YqNYrYUiMfg,"I suppose no matter how you spin it, it was just a dirty war. Sitting in trenches for weeks, rebuilding the parapets from previous shelling, re bagging. On guard, keeping a watchful eye, so tired, you lay your head against the wet sandbags, only to be stirred by any noise. Your knees and back feel like tooth aches. Mud and water, rubbers filled, while your feet were rotting. Just waiting and wondering. Navigating the trenches in pitch black, tripping and falling in the mud, the only thing to guide you was a voice, or cough. Just wondering when your relief would show, just to find some reprieve. Anything to pass the time, singing trench songs, writing, if you could find any dry spot. And then what seemed normal, suddenly was dampened by the sounds of artillery and the rain was replaced by shells. On and on, enough to make any man cry or go crazy."
YqNYrYUiMfg,Where‚Äôs the infiltrator kit when you need it
YqNYrYUiMfg,Looks like the best war movie since Saving Private Ryan. I just hope it's not like so many others and only show the best parts in the trailer.
YqNYrYUiMfg,I‚Äôm in.
YqNYrYUiMfg,Terrible time to live in
YqNYrYUiMfg,Just saw the advance screening and goddamn was it good.
YqNYrYUiMfg,This looks epic and amazing.. .
YqNYrYUiMfg,The war that ends all war
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Israel not coutry
Is real teroris"
YqNYrYUiMfg,"1917 was the year that the late Harry Patch mostly fought in especially in Passachdale.  And he famously said ‚ÄòIf any man tells you he went over the top and he wasn‚Äôt scared, he‚Äôs a damn liar‚Äô"
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Lovely plush green fields, they're in...
üòè"
YqNYrYUiMfg,I‚Äôm here for George Mackay

YqNYrYUiMfg,"ZIONISM versus BOLSHEVISM
A STRUGGLE FOR THE SOUL OF THE JEWISH PEOPLE.
By the Re. Hon. WINSTON S. CHURCHILL
ILLUSTRATED SUNDAY HERALD, FEBRUARY 8, 1920 

Some people like Jews and some do not; but no thoughtful man can doubt the fact that they are beyond all question the most formidable and the most remarkable race which has ever appeared in the world.
Disraeli, the Jew Prime Minister of England, and Leader of the Conservative Party, who was always true to his race and proud of his origin, said on a well-known occasion: ""The Lord deals with the nations as the nations deal with the Jews."" Certainly when we look at the miserable state of Russia, where of all countries in the world the Jews were the most cruelly treated, and contrast it with the fortunes of our own country, which seems to have been so providentially preserved amid the awful perils of these times, we must admit that nothing that has since happened in the history of the world has falsified the truth of Disraeli's confident assertion.

International Jews.
In violent opposition to all this sphere of Jewish effort rise the schemes of the International Jews. The adherents of this sinister confederacy are mostly men reared up among the unhappy populations of countries where Jews are persecuted on account of their race. Most, if not all, of them have forsaken the faith of their forefathers, and divorced from their minds all spiritual hopes of the next world. This movement among the Jews is not new. From the days of Spartacus-Weishaupt to those of Karl Marx, and down to Trotsky (Russia), Bela Kun (Hungary), Rosa Luxembourg (Germany), and Emma Goldman (United States), this world-wide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilization and for the reconstitution of society on the basis of arrested development, of envious malevolence, and impossible equality, has been steadily growing. It played, as a modern writer, Mrs. Webster, has so ably shown, a definitely recognizable part in the tragedy of the French Revolution. It has been the mainspring of every subversive movement during the Nineteenth Century; and now at last this band of extraordinary personalities from the underworld of the great cities of Europe and America have gripped the Russian people by the hair of their heads and have become practically the undisputed masters of that enormous empire.
Terrorist Jews.

There is no need to exaggerate the part played in the creation of Bolshevism and in the actual bringing about of the Russian Revolution, by these international and for the most part atheistical Jews, it is certainly a very great one; it probably outweighs all others. With the notable exception of Lenin, the majority of the leading figures are Jews. Moreover, the principal inspiration and driving power comes from the Jewish leaders. Thus Tchitcherin, a pure Russian, is eclipsed by his nominal subordinate Litvinoff, and the influence of Russians like Bukharin or Lunacharski cannot be compared with the power of Trotsky, or of Zinovieff, the Dictator of the Red Citadel (Petrograd) or of Krassin or Radek -- all Jews. In the Soviet institutions the predominance of Jews is even more astonishing. And the prominent, if not indeed the principal, part in the system of terrorism applied by the Extraordinary Commissions for Combating Counter-Revolution has been taken by Jews, and in some notable cases by Jewesses. The same evil prominence was obtained by Jews in the brief period of terror during which Bela Kun ruled in Hungary. The same phenomenon has been presented in Germany (especially in Bavaria), so far as this madness has been allowed to prey upon the temporary prostration of the German people. Although in all these countries there are many non-Jews every whit as bad as the worst of the Jewish revolutionaries, the part played by the latter in proportion to their numbers in the population is astonishing.

In 1935, Churchill criticized Germany for the very beliefs he himself had expressed in his 1920 article. In 1948, he said that the Nazi view of Bolshevism as a world-wide conspiracy of left wing Jews ruining Germany was a ‚Äúparanoid fantasy.‚Äù"

YqNYrYUiMfg,"I swear, every single bloody Hollywood WW1 movie either focuses entirely on either the Brits or Americans. I mean god forbid we focus on any other nation.
What were those folks, the ones that wore the grey tunics and the spiked hardened leather hats? Ah who cares, they lost!
Seriously though, when the fuck are we going to get a film that focuses on the Germans? I'm tired of the same Allies/Entente bullcrap that we've been getting for years.
You know what I want? I want a film that focuses on the Germans' stalemate with the French and British, the Austro-Hungarians trying to hold the Russians off while the Germans steam towards the eastern front, or the Ottomans tirelessly defending their empire from the British', Australians', and New Zealanders' dreadnought bombardment and land invasion. THOSE would make awesome films, but no... we get more Brits on the western front."
YqNYrYUiMfg,I'm still wondering who got shot at 1:53

PSR implies the act of running away from an immediate threat that is far larger than an average person, often in  a straight line, commonly done within an area that is quite large with zero obstructions in the way. 

Wish people would realize that it actually was smart to run through the building. While yes, it seems stupid, they mitigated the possible damage to themselves quite well by having the building take the brunt of the planes charge. In the situation they were in a large field, yes. But a decent amount of area was taken up around them by a building. So they used it to kill the momentum of the plane a bit instead of risking the pilot somehow swerving the plane towards them at the last moment, hitting the ground and exploding shrapnel into their backs."

YqNYrYUiMfg,"weird how they kept forcing the brother part, give the viewer some intellectual credit. I guess then the story feels incredibly easy to digest. like this will be an easy movie to watch for sure, I can't imagine the audience will need to deduce anything. But sometimes movies like that are great, like old school action movies or like John Wick, etc."
YqNYrYUiMfg,"lol oh how dreadful, so the premise is a brother sent to prevent a massacre? 20 000 fatalities on the first day of the Somme. There was no trap..... they were sent there by their Officers........."

YqNYrYUiMfg,"Just another Capitalist propaganda movie
WWI (and WWII, and every other war thereafter) was a CAPITALIST creation
These movies as narrated by the west, DO NOT tell the true story
Do yourself a favor and watch ""JFK to 911, Everything is a Rich Man's Trick""
*note that ""Rich Man"" in this context means CAPITALISTS

US and UK have always been narrating themselves as the good guys, but truth is that its actually the opposite, they are the ones who were and still are worst Imperialists on the planet, they are behind creation of all wars in the past 2-3 centuries, they are even the ones who funded (well the bankers did) Nazis in WWII and many capitalists even did business with them. You have been lied to your whole life, and your parents, and their parents, and their parents also. Remaining Monarchies and the top rich ""elites"" of the Capitalist west, are the actual Globalists and what people in the west call, The DEEP STATE."

I play the great score
There will be no encore
Great War
The war to end all wars

I'm standing here, I'm full of fear
With bodies at my feet
Over there, in the other trench
Bullets wear my name
Lead ahead, as the captain said
And show them no remorse
Who am I to understand
What have I become?

I do my duties, pay the price
I'll do the worthy sacrifice
I know my deeds are not in vain
Great War
And I cannot take more
Great tour
I keep on marching on
I play the great score
There will be no encore

The war to end all wars

And feet by feet
We pay the price of a mile, here
Though men are falling
We see heroes rise
We face the heat
As we are fighting until the dawn
So follow me, and we will write our own history

I play the great score
There will be no encore

YqNYrYUiMfg,"Why is there no movie of the first world war, where the feelings and the story of the german soldiers is shown? Always the britans or the us soldiers are the heros in hollywood movies. Please mention that the germans were in the same situation like the others."
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Britain was invaded anyway,our towns and cities no longer look like the people who died to save them..."
YqNYrYUiMfg,1917 is awesometacular.
YqNYrYUiMfg,I can't wait to see this.
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Am I the only one disappointed that a movie titled ""1917"" which takes place in the year 1917 is not set in Russia?"
YqNYrYUiMfg,"WHAT!!?? No gays, lesbians or black, disabled, gender fluid soldiers? How come the commanding officer isn't female??"
YqNYrYUiMfg,Where are the woke characters in this movie? Everybody knows that gay black non binary people had the leading role in ww1
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Ok, back to BF1 after this."
YqNYrYUiMfg,Tommen
YqNYrYUiMfg,"For perspective, 19,240 British soldiers died on the FIRST DAY of the Somme campaign in 1916."
YqNYrYUiMfg,Seeing how young the protagonists look If they dont play Motorhead's 1916 in the movie imah be sad ;(
YqNYrYUiMfg,1:18 they learned this running style from the famous rickon stark
YqNYrYUiMfg,Take my money!!!
YqNYrYUiMfg,I think the cinematography is superb.
YqNYrYUiMfg,Dear God please don't make this a woke movie. üôèüôè Sincerely All humans 2019
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Okay so Joker, Frozen 2 and 1917 and i guess i‚Äôm all for 2019"
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Yep, thats for me:)"
YqNYrYUiMfg,Is that Dr. Strange in the beginning?
YqNYrYUiMfg,"So help me *GOD,* if I see any blue face painted, 1 armed, bionic sniper females, or cricket bats or samurai swords..... üò†"
YqNYrYUiMfg,The fact this entire film is one single shot from start to finish should get you in the theatre.
YqNYrYUiMfg,Sherlock and Moriarty go way back to WW1 times guys!!
YqNYrYUiMfg,No field radios ?
YqNYrYUiMfg,"The British Army lost just over 700,000 men; from the British Isles, killed in WW1.  By my calculations the war was 1565 days long.  (July 28, 1914 - November 11, 1918)  So that means that on average the British Army lost about 447 killed per day for the entire war. (700,000 KIA / 1565 days in the war) That means the 1600 men who were in danger of being ambushed and wiped out in this trailer represented less than 4 days average losses of men killed for the British Army.  (Those are horrendous numbers and it doesn't even include the wounded.)"
YqNYrYUiMfg,The actors look far to healthy. The average British Tommy was underweight and smaller than todays average and looked older because of the poor diet and hard work of the time.
YqNYrYUiMfg,It's nice to see a movie about the war no one talks about much. All we see are WW2 or Vietnam . I know enough about them..
YqNYrYUiMfg,Parece um filme meio clich√™. Acho mais interessante quando o foco √© a hist√≥ria em si e as manobras nas batalhas. N√£o gosto quando tem um ar her√≥ico de mocinhos.
YqNYrYUiMfg,Any when is going to be in movie
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Colin Firth is the worst actor of all time..that said, I can't wait to see this movie, the rest of the cast are great and it reminds me of WW1 video games that I love to play."
YqNYrYUiMfg,my former military self is alive!!!
YqNYrYUiMfg,"In a way, I'd like to go and see it, but I probably won't. This isn't Omaha Beach. This is industrial slaughter on a scale that the film industry technically can't capture, and morally is not capable of. The two divisions who went up in reserve at Loos in 1915 were literally ordered to stand still and be slaughtered by German artillery. But then I guess the sanitisation is a modern requirement."
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Oh great, another movie to fuck with the masses' perception of World War One"
YqNYrYUiMfg,So was this a single shot because of a budget? Or just did an flawless job?
YqNYrYUiMfg,i dont care if this movie could possibly win an oscar but the trailer makes it look BORING. Hope i will be proven wrong when it comes at the cinemas
YqNYrYUiMfg,No Cultural appropriation like Battlefield. No CGI like Midway. I'm fucking in.
YqNYrYUiMfg,Looks amazing
YqNYrYUiMfg,Saving Ryan the Private
YqNYrYUiMfg,Cheesy music ruined it
YqNYrYUiMfg,I'm still waiting for a World War movie that portrays Canada's involvement
YqNYrYUiMfg,Waiting for leftists complaining about the lack of diversity...
YqNYrYUiMfg,Wait... I have a cunning plan!
YqNYrYUiMfg,"They Shall Be Remembered by Peter Jackson, LOTR, Hobbit director, was one of the best films I ever saw, a documentary, but amazing. This looks a bit fictional, like Private Ryan, but of course Ill see it and see for myself."
YqNYrYUiMfg,Saving private Pike.
YqNYrYUiMfg,*We are losing objective Butter*
YqNYrYUiMfg,I sure hope it¬¥s way better than it¬¥s trailer !!
YqNYrYUiMfg,1942=90
YqNYrYUiMfg,Can these trailers please stop spoiling tense scenes before I even get to see the fucking movie please. Good god
YqNYrYUiMfg,Lord of the rings anno 1917
YqNYrYUiMfg,Battlefield 1 players will enjoy this movie including me
YqNYrYUiMfg,Come on...it's lensed by Roger Deakins... atleast its going to be a visual masterpiece.
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Looks like a great movie. Trailer problem...''HOPE IS A DANGEROUS THING''.. Stolen directly from Shawshank Redemption. Good line, but painfully redundant to anyone (all of us) who has seen Shawshank."
YqNYrYUiMfg,Will this be more epic than Cats?

YqNYrYUiMfg,"This film will be classed as racist, full of bigotry and non inclusive by the progressive far left, alphabet crowd and feminists! Though I bet they can quickly squeeze in a man on man scene to try and please these wankers!"
YqNYrYUiMfg,According to NYT this is now considered a contender for best picture at the Oscars this year.
YqNYrYUiMfg,Is it coming up to december 2020? Or this year?
YqNYrYUiMfg,War movies are the thing bruh ‚ù§Ô∏è
YqNYrYUiMfg,üòáüí©! HOLY SHIT! This looks extraordinary.
YqNYrYUiMfg,This looks good.
YqNYrYUiMfg,They're holding their rifles like modern troops would...that's not right. Otherwise looks interesting.
YqNYrYUiMfg,This trailer is actually really good! As in even after I see movie I can return good like Infinity war and Endgame trailer good!
YqNYrYUiMfg,Looks boring.
YqNYrYUiMfg,so... no one is going to talk about Sherlock and Moriarty in the same movie ;)
YqNYrYUiMfg,wanna play BF1 again.
YqNYrYUiMfg,"""The war to end all wars""... It actually led to the fall of the Russian, German, and Ottoman Empires only to forcefully cripple Europe's #1 economy, Germany's, and immediately give rise to communism - which ultimate ransacked and degraded half of Europe with the aid of U.K. and U.S.A.  

Truth be told, England's actions in WWI (whose true interest was securing the influence of its moribund British Empire at the expense of the more capable, yet smaller, German Empire) set the stage for WWII and all the proxy wars that followed. 

But, of course, history told by Hollywood will keep it trivial enough to where even victims of the Amritsar Massacre would shout ""God Save the Queen"" by the end of the film."
YqNYrYUiMfg,I didnt even know this was a movie until Jeremy reviewed it today
YqNYrYUiMfg,Nice üëç
YqNYrYUiMfg,Reminds me a little of that 71‚Äô film as well although completely different theatre just has that pattern.
YqNYrYUiMfg,ÂÇªÈÄº
YqNYrYUiMfg,My favorite war film is probably Hacksaw Ridge. Excited to see this.
YqNYrYUiMfg,WWI movie.  I am very interested in watching it.  1917
YqNYrYUiMfg,"its all one shot!!!'
(made to look like one)"
YqNYrYUiMfg,War..... It's FANTASTIC!
YqNYrYUiMfg,looks insane
YqNYrYUiMfg,Looks pretty good.
YqNYrYUiMfg,The last few shots feels a little like the ending of Gallipoli.  I'm hoping it ends better for these characters.
YqNYrYUiMfg,"good to see sam & frodo again ;)  (i cant take full credit on that, Jeremy Jahns pointed it out): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5aAcMMSqVs"
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Why is it, in EVERY war movie, it shows people running WITH a crashing plane instead off to the one side instead, where the plane ISN'T going to crash??"
YqNYrYUiMfg,Very nice. Going to watch this!
YqNYrYUiMfg,Lots of privileged White boys in that war.
YqNYrYUiMfg,Tim Cruise would have KILLED that running sequence at the end
YqNYrYUiMfg,I hope that wasn't autotune on the vocals for the music....
YqNYrYUiMfg,That title card transition is probably my favorite for any movie trailer
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Yes, bit the.music of the trailer sucks"
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Historical plot: *exists*
Benadryl cucumbersnatch: it's free real estate."
YqNYrYUiMfg,Seems like a cool idea but that autotuned bullshit called music is not on.
YqNYrYUiMfg,Looks great will recommend it to our followers thanks
YqNYrYUiMfg,i didn't know sherlock and moriarte had a long running relationship!
YqNYrYUiMfg,"And the award for best Cinematography goes to Roger Deakins.

Check out this guys credits - amazing body of work."
YqNYrYUiMfg,Again those obviously fake computer generated muzzle flashes. I wonder how they made war movies before the existence of Windows 95
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Dear Universal Studios,
If you care for all the Indian movie-goers, please do release 1917 in India. @universalstudios"
YqNYrYUiMfg,If one movie made me quit feminism it was a Canadian movie titled Paschendale? Not in theatres. Anyone see it?
YqNYrYUiMfg,"I had no idea what this film was about nor had any plans on seeing it in theatres ever, but because a friend got to the theatre late this gave us no choice but to watch this film. It did not disappoint, an instant classic. I have no clue who these two actors are but after this film, they'll be instant stars. The best part about the film is the way it was filmed, it literally felt like the whole movie took no more than three takes to create which was so awesome because even though the movie follows these two soldiers during most of the film, the editing made it seem like it had no cut scenes making the viewer feel like they were the third character in the film, it was pretty mind-blowing."
YqNYrYUiMfg,99% of people only care about World War II. Why is that?
YqNYrYUiMfg,"I love that sequel Spielberg just completed ""Saving Ryan's Second Cousin""."
YqNYrYUiMfg,I'm deeply concerned by the lack of diversity and representation in this movie.
YqNYrYUiMfg,To clean looking for WW1  .... fail
YqNYrYUiMfg,"""And the Oscar goes to""."
YqNYrYUiMfg,I realy fed up English and Americans are good people and the rest of the world are bad.
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Should be good but why not drop a message by aircraft instead of sending men across a battlefield? Oh. Then there would be no movie, sorry."
YqNYrYUiMfg,Battlefield 1
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Could be good, could be terrible, it's Hollywood afterall."
YqNYrYUiMfg,I can only think of Frodo and Sam looking at this.
YqNYrYUiMfg,uncannily similar to Saving Private Ryan........
YqNYrYUiMfg,Fatima Portugal was the point of 1917
YqNYrYUiMfg,"where,s the women lol"
YqNYrYUiMfg,We have taken Objective Charlie.
YqNYrYUiMfg,Hope it's as good as the trailer. I'm still getting over my disappointment with Dunkirk.
YqNYrYUiMfg,Ok I'm sold
YqNYrYUiMfg,I wish this was out now. It would make a great Christmas present for my husband.
YqNYrYUiMfg,2:08 only thing I didn't like he didn't even flinch from the explosion. Anyone would have. Bad acting here...
YqNYrYUiMfg,I want more Thanos
YqNYrYUiMfg,"They lost about 19,000 men on the first day at the Somme."
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Couldn't they just use carrier pigeons? OK, if it's a dumb question.....in any case, I am generally game for war movies. I will skip ""Midway"" not because of bad reviews, but I can't stand CGI. The good news on ""1917"" is at least purportedly, ""they use minimal CGI."" Good on them."
YqNYrYUiMfg,tommen ! is that you ???
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Usually, Great War movies stink. They didn‚Äôt show anything that would make this an exception. Incidently these must be British soldiers as Americans didn‚Äôt reach the field until April, 1918."
YqNYrYUiMfg,Enemy Behemoth en route
YqNYrYUiMfg,Dunkirk part 2
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Europe for Europeans - Stop the Great Replacement

YqNYrYUiMfg,"Whoa!  A movie that doesn‚Äôt feature minorities, women, gays, or identity politics?  

I‚Äôll buy tickets to that"
YqNYrYUiMfg,Seems very similar to Gallipoli (1981).
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Who cares about massacre in ww1? You think any general even cared about a few thousands dead bodies?
It was a slaughter every minute. No one would even retract bad orders and mistakes."
YqNYrYUiMfg,Color?!?
YqNYrYUiMfg,"‚ÄúWe Need To Keep Moving!‚Äù
My brain: ‚ÄúSome CoD Missions‚Äù"
YqNYrYUiMfg,oh my god this looks amazing! I bet those two soldiers got fucked up in the trenches as they walked through the tunnel.
YqNYrYUiMfg,"General: ""If we don't get there in time, we'll lose...1600 men""

*The Battle of Somme* : am I a joke to you?"
YqNYrYUiMfg,Reading notes from WW1 . It was horrifying.  Can't describe on YouTube.  Really it's horrifying.
YqNYrYUiMfg,Is that Benedict Cumberbatch ? This cannot possibly be a bad movie.
YqNYrYUiMfg,Is it true this movie only have 1 take/shoot?
YqNYrYUiMfg,battlefield 1 vibes
YqNYrYUiMfg,"1600 men in WW1 was nothing. Some battles lost 500,000+ on both sides. In Gallipoli alone the UK had 302,000 casualties."
YqNYrYUiMfg,This entire movie was taken in a single shot atleast for that this should be seen in theaters by everyone
YqNYrYUiMfg,"hvorfor gj√∏r ikke regiss√∏rer som Spielberg eller Mendes en film om koreakrigen? Nolan?Det er mange filmer om verdenskrigene, men det er knapt noen filmer om Koreakrigen.üá∫üá∏üá¨üáßüá∞üá∑ VS. üá®üá≥üá∞üáµüá∑üá∫. Jun 25, 1950 ‚Äì Jul 27, 1953"
YqNYrYUiMfg,Just looks lame and slow with explosions.
YqNYrYUiMfg,Song?
YqNYrYUiMfg,1600 men in World War I?  That's pong.  They hardly even noticed casualty figures that low!
YqNYrYUiMfg,"""Hope is a dangerous thing"". This quote is what is known as a ""deepity"".  It sounds profound, wise, poetic, intellectual, etc.  But in actuality, ""hope"" is one of those words that can be used for any number of purposes and in just about any dramatic situation.  ""Hope is making a comeback!"""
YqNYrYUiMfg,Very interesting.
YqNYrYUiMfg,The British generals commanding troops in World War I were nearly all incompetent butchers especially Field Marshal Haig.

YqNYrYUiMfg,This single player story DLC for Battlefield I looks good.
YqNYrYUiMfg,Sam Mendes is an amazing director!
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Was guessing at what the downed German plane might be--from what little we see in the trailer looks like perhaps an Albatros, Pfalz or maybe a Roland.  This looks like an impressive film.  I'd like to catch it."
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Toxic masculinity saved the world many times from total anarchy and chaos. So i see this film as defeating two of the worlds greatest evils. The old Empiric world and the new communist empire that seeks to make us all as miserable as those who sat in the trenches with piss, shit and rats chewing on their dead friends. My Great Grandfather won a medal for attacking a bunker alone and killing 17 men using only grenades and his bayonet. He was an Irish man fighting for the British army so they just threw him out to every hard location because his human value was lower than that of an English soldier. Eventually though he made rank and made many friends out of his battalion. Was injured 3 times also. He rarely talked about the war and use to have nightmares, waking up screaming and crying because of what he done to those poor German boys he blew up with grenades. My Dad, 'his son' once said when he was badly drunk one night he described in detail how he had to mercy kill a young boy because his guts were all over the place and he was begging for him to do it. Tore the man to bits. So when new age era sjw twats talk shit about toxic masculinity i wish there was a war i could place them in as bad as those that we are lucky not to have taken part in."
YqNYrYUiMfg,Never forget....
YqNYrYUiMfg,Infantry.
YqNYrYUiMfg,I just leaned that this is supposed to be a ‚Äúsingle shot‚Äù film! More excited than ever for this now!
YqNYrYUiMfg,One-shot war movie.This is something I desperately waited for my entire life and I never assumed anyone will try to do this. And it's coming five days after my birthday.

(You fellow history geeks will know what I'm talking about. üòè) Correct me if I'm wrong but I believe that's something that has never been done in a movie before and if they do it right the results could be phenomenal! Can't wait till December."

YqNYrYUiMfg,"Lol when that plane was going down all he had to do was run sideways to get to safety, but no he decided to run to where the plane was going down. Hollywood logic at it‚Äôs best."

YqNYrYUiMfg,Why is it always British
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Really cool that ww1 is being more and more recognized between movies and even videos games. When I was a kid, i had absolutely no knowledge of ww1. I only knew about wwll because of movies like ""saving private ryan"" and ""band of brothers"" and call of duty 1-3."
YqNYrYUiMfg,Does this have anything to do with the British Arras Offensive or the Battle of Campari?
YqNYrYUiMfg,The carnage of WW I is indescribable--and often overlooked.
YqNYrYUiMfg,Does anyone know the song at 1:25
YqNYrYUiMfg,"More Jewish propaganda, instead of the truth, the new York funded and founded coup and destruction of Russia, the Romanoff family, and the murder of over 40 million human beings, as well as the Jewish seeds of communism, that led to ww2 Korea, Vietnam, and the total deaths at over 200 million people! And counting!!!!"
YqNYrYUiMfg,"So this about world war 1 right?......






Yea im watchin this movie fo sure fo sure."
YqNYrYUiMfg,"is this the prequel to national lampoon's 1943? If so, this ought to be even funnier! Can't wait!"
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Personally, I am hyped for this movie but I want something that happened other than this made up story (forgive me if I am wrong but I‚Äôm sure that this story of finding a brother or something never happened) I want to see what happened in the trenches more than what‚Äôs happening around it because that‚Äôs where everything happened, the trenches. I bet this movie will have some trench scenes but it will shift to these guys reaching the advancing army or something in that manner. As being a WWI fanatic I want to see more of what happened other than ‚ÄúYeah sure this happened but that‚Äôs boorish so we tied in a story to keep things interesting for the audience.‚Äù"

YqNYrYUiMfg,For ww1 those sets look pristine. That no-mans land was very ‚Äúclean‚Äù (in the trailer at least.) i‚Äôm hoping this isn‚Äôt another pg-13 ww1 but with all the nasty bits cleaned up. Just once i would like to see a realistic ww1 trench warfare film in all its gruesome horror. So i‚Äôm hoping that they just cherry picked the cleanest scenes or purposefully leaned those scenes (tv edit) for the trailer so as not to frighten away the audience.

Or a series of all different ww2 air battles b29s and the Japanese trying to take it down with ramming attacks , a story behind a kamkaize ohka bomber, a German me 262 pilot, a British spitfire in the Battle of Britain we need some crazy historical movie series that deliver accuracy and ties you with different characters."

YqNYrYUiMfg,Pigeons were on strike that day.
YqNYrYUiMfg,Spoiler alert: Tommen Baratheon will find a suitable tower to jump from.
YqNYrYUiMfg,Hope this will be a master piece
YqNYrYUiMfg,Best trailer I‚Äôve ever seen. No spoilers just pure art.
YqNYrYUiMfg,Breathtaking trailer
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Give me this over ""Yee Rah"" Midway any day"
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Would rather re-watch Gallipoli (1981).
At least this doesn't look like it was shot in ""spasticated monkey on crack with a cheap handheld camera style"". Didn't see any 4/5 screen obscured by the back of someone's head ""I'm an artiste!"" (John Adams) bullshit. But where the hell are today's Akira Kurosawas and John Fords?"
YqNYrYUiMfg,Is this another battlefield game?
YqNYrYUiMfg,Is this movie based on true story??
YqNYrYUiMfg,Sherlock and Moriarty seem to have discovered time travel... oh dear
YqNYrYUiMfg,I want movies with German perspective
YqNYrYUiMfg,i bet this wont be violent
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Looking at the state of London today, someone sure fucked up somewhere"
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Yay. Another epic telltale about the British's heroism during WWI, which seems will once again totally occult the millions of French soldiers they fought and died alongside with in the trenches, IN FRANCE."
YqNYrYUiMfg,Everyone's making BF1 memes and I'm just happy to see another Great War film
YqNYrYUiMfg,what is music ? please :)
YqNYrYUiMfg,I think it's about German-french war and hero is France and Willian is Germany
YqNYrYUiMfg,Frodo and Sam in WW1
YqNYrYUiMfg,"I would recomend you watch it 
Sajjan singh  rangroot please"
YqNYrYUiMfg,What‚Äôs the background song called?
YqNYrYUiMfg,I wish I could have been a background extra for this movie! Looks awesome
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Saving Private Ryan + Dunkirk
Roger Deakins is his DP. Reason enough to see it"
YqNYrYUiMfg,Weird... I'm French and Hollywood movies are always about British/ American soldiers... What about the rest ?
YqNYrYUiMfg,"*Female voice in the background*.   ‚ÄúWe lost objective Butter‚Äù

Jesus! I‚Äôve never got thins many likes, the most I‚Äôve gotten was 7"
YqNYrYUiMfg,If Christopher Nolan was directing this it would have HUGE box office. That being said I still think this'll do well.
YqNYrYUiMfg,I thought Tommen Baratheon  was dead
YqNYrYUiMfg,German perspective would be interesting. Pass.
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Never thought I would see Robb Stark,Doctor Strange and James moriarty on the same screen"
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Didn't the British have a whole battalion of pigeons for this type of thing? I'm pretty sure one of them won the Victorian Cross or something. Don't get me wrong, I'm still gonna watch this movie. It looks like really good!"
YqNYrYUiMfg,"This movie doesn‚Äôt seem to really re-create the true horrors of the trenches. After the film, Thy Shall Not Grow Old, any WW1 movie should inspire to recreate that atmosphere. That means heavy, war violence as well as carnage on a level as saving private Ryan. Men being wounded by gasses and bodies torn apart. So far all the action scenes don‚Äôt really display any true grafic nature of a war. I hope I am proven wrong, yet so far it doesn‚Äôt appear to be that kind of movie.."
YqNYrYUiMfg,Looks to be a very good movie. Many WW1 movies are really poorly done.
YqNYrYUiMfg,Theres only one way this ends and is a last man standing? are they gonna have a wrestling match or something?
YqNYrYUiMfg,Waiting for this movie... Who wants to wait to watch this ....
YqNYrYUiMfg,Release the pigeon!!!

YqNYrYUiMfg,"My brother is annoying as fuck. But I'd do anything to save him.

Which this trailer leaves tension in my heart and a pit  in my stomach. 

Kind of reminds me of watching legend of the fall. I think this should be a good movie."
YqNYrYUiMfg,it's not world war it's street war
YqNYrYUiMfg,Movie tropes and one liners ... because the Great War was boring. Just die already Hellwood.
YqNYrYUiMfg,So this is basically the movie Gallipoli
YqNYrYUiMfg,It‚Äôs a great year Mid Way and then 1917 nice

YqNYrYUiMfg,I‚Äôm looking forward to this movie. I‚Äôll be seeing this instead of Episode IX
YqNYrYUiMfg,They should do the korean war next
YqNYrYUiMfg,Hopefully it will be better than Dunkirk and show what ww1 really was instead of showing the French as cowards and the German as pure Devils... I guess I ask too much tho...
YqNYrYUiMfg,"The twist is that his brother isn't even there, isn't it?"
YqNYrYUiMfg,1:23
YqNYrYUiMfg,Cinematography by Roger Deakins.  Need I say more?
YqNYrYUiMfg,Another world war movie about british people.

YqNYrYUiMfg,A war that was started by the satanic new world order after they purposely sank the titanic to get rid of 5 people who opposed the federal reserve. Do some research people. Everyrhing that has ever been taught to us is a lie.

Modi Terrorist Modi Terrorist

YqNYrYUiMfg,This looks epic
YqNYrYUiMfg,So it's a cross between the movies Gallipoli and Saving Private Ryan? But with Doctor Strange avoiding saying the word 'Penguin'?
YqNYrYUiMfg,"If you don't get there in time we will lose 1600 men and your brother... 

No pressure or anything"

YqNYrYUiMfg,"So two things you may pick up from the trailer but isn‚Äôt outwardly stated:

It‚Äôs in real time over 2 hours

But u never made a movie  or even a series neither any western media shown or written the situation of Bhartiya sena (Indian soliders)  during war... They fought against Germans supporting Britain.. U must know that 62,000 soliders died on battle ground and 67,000 soliders wounded... So total 75,000 soliders died in the war... Why??? They gave their life only because Britishers who exploited Bharatvarsh (India) who were also the rulers of British India at that time said that we will free India once we win war against germans... So this poor people joined British army and fought for them but here's one twist... After British won the war they took u turn from their promise and they announced more taxes on Indians to incure the loses they faced during First world war.... So what was that... Sorry but I have to say you people are so allegic towards truth that u never told or written this courageous history of Indian soliders in your History text books because u never wanted to show this thing to your future generations don't you??? You people made statues of great solders died in First and Second world war... U guys even made statues of animals who died during this 2 great wars but why you never made even a single statue of Indian Solider who died; gave up his life to save Great or I must say not so Great Britain... Shame on all of you... I do have a great story about Britishers what they did to Bharatvarsh (india)  during Second world war... So Hollywood please make movie about second world war so that I can expose the mentality of Hollywood, Britishers and Western Media about Bharatvarsh (India)."

If they are, then "" maybe"" it should show the Canadians, Irish, Welsh and ANZACs who did a SHITLOAD of the bleeding and DYING for King, the Butcher Haig, and "" Empire""

I'm ASSuming the story line is revolvong around the 3rd Battle of Ypres ( Battle of Passchendaele)

WW1 was the biggest penis measuring contest ever and to this day they are still turning over 103 yr old poison gas rounds, live unexploded bombs, mortar and cannon shells as well as the body and bone fragments of british , french, belgian and german soldiers from french farmland that was once battle fields...."

They aslo never mentioned in 1943 brit PM Winston Churchill took away all the  rice and wheat from bengal for the surplus ration of brit soldiers in ww2 which resulted in great bengal famine causes a death of 10 million people but they never mentioned for a single sec abt India's contributions in both the Ww.

I've sen video of my brother's squad doing this in training, but he's a U.S. Army Ranger in 2019.

YqNYrYUiMfg,"Another war movie about one of the world wars? From the British/American perspective? Yawn.

Perhaps doing some research on other cultures during those parts of history would have been a nice change; it could really broaden people's horizon and maybe even rekindle interest with other countries/cultures that maybe don't get enough credit (there are exceptions, of course, however even then most films portray other countries/ethnicity as defenceless or hopeless. When in actuality there were a lot of defenceless people to be sure - but they were also a lot of heroes too; with and without a helmet and badge)

I mean, this was called World war for a reason; not American War or British War. 

The worst you can be in a war movie is either boring (besides a few action set pieces, special effects, and some guy trying to find his brother in the trailer; there does not seem to be enough character or anything interesting in terms of a story driven narrative within the historical setting - it's simply taking the world war 1 template again and recycling it without much care besides the visuals) or insultingly inaccurate (and that trend hasn't ended with a significant amount of American/British films in terms of having a narrow scope of the war - thus a lot of the plots like saving private Ryan contain weak stories when it should have been the equivalent of Lord of the Rings with alliances from other nations, huge battles, character, culture clashes, etc). 

What happened to studios taking risks (especially nowadays when we need it more than ever?) Universal is a big company; so big that they're currently collaborating with other giants from across the globe like Nintendo to work on a theme park and a movie adaptation of Mario! 

You can afford to take a few risks. Anything new, original, artistic, daring, different, I'll go watch it. No sequel, remake; or another generic war movies. I know it's possible."

YqNYrYUiMfg,"01:13 The pilot did not use the hill to land his crashing plane smoothly only goes to show/indicate he's terrified of whatever is coming after him from beyond that hill which clearly shot him down or that he's dead already! I can and will say the reaction of the soldier in the barn-like structure is really slow. These two were clearly not on guard and did not take any caution when approaching a hill with God knows what on the other side! Letting your guard down in war is like falling asleep when you are supposed to be the lookout. In war, you would be dead. If you don't think that the plane was coming down from whatever was beyond that hill and that it isn't being followed by a throng of soldiers you are sorely mistaken! Do you know what is coming behind that hill? Trust me, it's much worse than that plane! If you don't run in the direction of the plane/barn (cover) your dead already! It's not that he was running from the plane! Heck, the pilot could just turn and land anywhere even using the downward slope from the hill to land but the pilot was fleeing what shot him down in the first place from beyond that hill! The pilot was himself just trying to get as much distance and cover from those persuing him from beyond the hill! Any deviation from that direction would result in immediate death from the throng of incoming soldiers from beyond that hill! Once he gets around that structure he can use it as cover to continue to run from those chasing him beyond that hill. It's a matter of putting cover and distance between you and numerous advancing enemies for survival! Did I mention hill enough for ya? :D"

YqNYrYUiMfg,The days when men were men
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Did a bit of digging and this film is based off his grandfathers actions during the battle of Passchendaele from October 1917 (according to interviews). Looking forward to watching this film but I just can‚Äôt get over how clean they‚Äôve made it look. October was 4 MONTHS into the battle, by which time the surrounding countryside had been bombarded to oblivion and was largely underwater. Dunkirk has the same problem, they just made everything look too clean."
YqNYrYUiMfg,bf1
YqNYrYUiMfg,1:27  Umm??? Is it me or is there literally no sky?

YqNYrYUiMfg,Holly shit this hearth renching
YqNYrYUiMfg,1600 men seems like a small drop in the bucket compared to the whole war.
YqNYrYUiMfg,Finally! A WW1 movie
YqNYrYUiMfg,Amazing how far modern warfare has progressed. World War one would be over in weeks with the tech we have now.
YqNYrYUiMfg,Hopefully this is the WWI movie I‚Äôve always wanted

YqNYrYUiMfg,Where is the handicap women with hooks?
YqNYrYUiMfg,Cant wait to see someone with lewis gun and kill 64 people in the head with one bullet

YqNYrYUiMfg,Battlefield?
YqNYrYUiMfg,Yea! A war that many forget.

YqNYrYUiMfg,—ç—Ç–æ –∫—Ä—É—Ç–æ
YqNYrYUiMfg,1917
YqNYrYUiMfg,Sean Mendes directing this???
YqNYrYUiMfg,"What really pisses me off is this; In both the World Wars, the Brits controlled most of Africa and India as colonies. And over a million peasant Indians were sent from India to fight Britain's war, and even then, they fought bravely and turned the tables in favor of Britain. More than half the food and ships and whatnot that was used in the war were looted from India. And it's a well known fact that without the British Indian Army, the Nazis would've won. 
AND YET. In a movie based on the ""grounded reality"" of World War I, we see a British guy running heroically through gun firing and bomb blasts probably yelling ""crikey mate"" without even a hint of any colored men who actually fought the war for them. Just shows how the British is still the narcissistic piece of shit like it always was from over 200 years ago."
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Like in Battlefield 1, playing with no mic, trying to reach your squad at delta but you are stucked in alpha near enemy respawn..."

YqNYrYUiMfg,I thought it was of October revolution
YqNYrYUiMfg,Bf1
YqNYrYUiMfg,We already know the SJWs are going to say this movie is bad because there is no minorities

Is this movie inspired by CoD and Battlefield games?"
YqNYrYUiMfg,And the Oscar for Cinematography goes to -  RD
YqNYrYUiMfg,Saving brother Ryan
YqNYrYUiMfg,Finally a good movie
YqNYrYUiMfg,No mention of Roger Deakins in the description? The man deserves waaay more headlines for his work.
YqNYrYUiMfg,We are losing objective butter
YqNYrYUiMfg,"God this looks like a visual feast. I cant wait, sam mendes knows how to direct the camera."
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Battlefield 1 should take notes.....oh, wait. ü§îü§î"

YqNYrYUiMfg,Looks like a cross between saving Private Ryan and Dunkirk

YqNYrYUiMfg,Is it just me or are there a lot of digital modifications on peoples faces in this trailer?? Many of the cuts the faces didn't look natural.
YqNYrYUiMfg,"I just read that this movie apparently isn't gonna have any cuts. It's gonna be all in one continuous take.
Like Birdman, but not boring."
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Please be rated R, so we don't have to deal with some over sanitized Universal/Disney version of war."
YqNYrYUiMfg,"I feel like the cinematography in BOB and The Pacific gave a far more believable vintage war-like vibe. Same with SPR. When they show you 40s stuff, it felt genuine. Like you can feel the grit, and can actually picture yourself being there. If that makes sense. I dunno why, but them current war movies just feels...dull."
YqNYrYUiMfg,Another WW1 movie about the British... *sigh*
YqNYrYUiMfg,Kodjima is a genius
YqNYrYUiMfg,when you play brothers in arms hells highway game
YqNYrYUiMfg,"If they didn't references black adder, then I'm gonna be mad"

YqNYrYUiMfg,Dreadnaught is available
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Finally, another WWI movie! It‚Äôs been forever. And it looks like it will be portrayed very well! I‚Äôm really excited! People often overlook the First World War, and it is crucial that we remember that part of history. Really looking forward to this!"
YqNYrYUiMfg,"This will either end up amazing, or average. Shooting an entire film in a single shot can come off as gimmicky in my opinion."
YqNYrYUiMfg,It remember me Battlefield 1
YqNYrYUiMfg,A ww1 movie? That's been a while
YqNYrYUiMfg,Guys need to learn how to run
YqNYrYUiMfg,Battlefield real :D

YqNYrYUiMfg,If battlefield 1 had a movie about conquest
YqNYrYUiMfg,*Battlefield 1*
YqNYrYUiMfg,"If you take the cinematography/editing style of ‚ÄúBirdman‚Äù and put it together with a war epic similar to ‚ÄúDunkirk,‚Äù this is the result and one that will find a place in the film history books by the time awards season begins. Roger Deakins is definitely winning the Best Cinematography award again this year (that image of the soldier running towards the camera amid the explosions and running soldiers at the end of the trailer is quickly on its way to becoming an iconic image that won‚Äôt leave our minds after we see both this trailer and the film itself). Can‚Äôt wait to see this!"
YqNYrYUiMfg,Lol these bf1 comments tho
YqNYrYUiMfg,whats the name of the song in the trailer

YqNYrYUiMfg,This looks like a movie made for Battlefield I
YqNYrYUiMfg,"My ancestors fought in this war and for what??? my family tells the story that all they did was kill other poor people who were just following orders, while the elite laughed and joked about it."
YqNYrYUiMfg,"1:18 When your plane's damaged, and you decided to go kamikaze. 


Truly a Battlefield I refference"
YqNYrYUiMfg,I want to see this in IMAX
YqNYrYUiMfg,This like the 1933th world war movie this year.

WE‚ÄôRE LOSING CHARLIE!"
YqNYrYUiMfg,A carrier pigeon would have solved the entire movie
YqNYrYUiMfg,I keep thinking this is Wonder Woman 1984
YqNYrYUiMfg,"When will the poor stop killing each other on behalf of the rich????
Everyone knows it but lets say it again. The german royal family went to war with the british royal family who were their cousins and did any of them  die?? No just the poor. Like every case throughout time."
YqNYrYUiMfg,I think it is based on Russian Revolution 1917... Very powerful movie... ‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫

YqNYrYUiMfg,Can some one get the microwave
YqNYrYUiMfg,"The Germans were not the bad guys in the first world war, the Brits make it look like it."
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Small point; but English speakers do not use the phrase "" sixteen hundred"". This is a purely American way of speaking. They would say ""one thousand six hundred"""
YqNYrYUiMfg,Finally something that might actually be worth watching this year.
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Stop showing so many details in the fucking trailer,I feel like I watched the damn movie already."
YqNYrYUiMfg,"I‚Äôm so glad to get some kind of modern film about ww1, it is such a brutal and intense war with many interesting turning points in technology I don‚Äôt know why more people have tried to portray this war"
YqNYrYUiMfg,Se ve interesante
YqNYrYUiMfg,Note the scene where the two First World War soldiers appear to adopt American squad tactics when searching the trench.....the correct term for this is....anachronism......or....a pathetic cockup......
YqNYrYUiMfg,"A british messenger eh? Imagine if they¬†meet a¬†fellow messenger from german army and, understanding the pain of this job, decided to¬†spare him..."
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Finally

YqNYrYUiMfg,1917 vs Hacksawridge vs Saving Private Ryan
YqNYrYUiMfg,"The premise is fucking stupid, no officer during ww1 gave a shit about 1600 men.

That said, I'll still see this, there are sadly too few movies/TV shows that cover The Great War."
YqNYrYUiMfg,this looks great!
YqNYrYUiMfg,Why is the battlefield so clean lmfao
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Please Universal, Take my money."
YqNYrYUiMfg,"I love war movies, but not so pumped about this one. Hopefully it‚Äôs good tho"

YqNYrYUiMfg,"Nothing to see here.
Tommen committing suicide again."
YqNYrYUiMfg,Can Universal do more of this and less of trash Mummy remakes? Thanks.
YqNYrYUiMfg,can already tell it gonna be the best war movie from this year
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Shave one year off and you would have had the perfect chance to use Motorhead's ""1916"" as a part of the soundtrack."

Edit: The last good one was in the 30‚Äôs."
YqNYrYUiMfg,YES WW1 ISN'T COVERED NEARLY ENOUGH IN FILM OR GAMES!! Such a fascinating time it's shameful how little attention it gets.
YqNYrYUiMfg,They all r using *kar98 k* without any *scope*
YqNYrYUiMfg,"So, Sherlock and Moriarty work for English Army together...."
YqNYrYUiMfg,Tries to be ww1 doesn't look anything like it.
YqNYrYUiMfg,"After experiencing the epic nature of Dunkirk and Battlefield 1, I‚Äôm ready for another world war movie."
YqNYrYUiMfg,why would some dislike this?   stupid sad humans that dont know shit about history.

YqNYrYUiMfg,DARREN TILL AT THE BEGINNING
YqNYrYUiMfg,Live action cod
YqNYrYUiMfg,Feminists are going to complain about lack of female protagonist probably.
YqNYrYUiMfg,I was enjoying it until that stupid music started.

YqNYrYUiMfg,Call of Duty ?
YqNYrYUiMfg,Interesting. I didn't know that WW1 ended with just a single man standing...
YqNYrYUiMfg,This trailer is giving me Michael Bay vibes. Hoping it's not just a straight up popcorn action flick
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Msg to film producers. 1917 epic trailer. Congrats. What about a movie about the A5/V2 slave technicians who put man's first rocket into outer space,  October 3, 1942!!!! In early 1945 the V2 was supposed to falling on NYC and the USN was scrubbing the north Atlantic looking for the specially equipped ""V2 U-Boats"". Look it up."
YqNYrYUiMfg,How much would it take to make a German perspective
YqNYrYUiMfg,Looks like a good movie hopefully it is

YqNYrYUiMfg,Very much gunna see this. WWI don't get enough attention
YqNYrYUiMfg,I'm ready for it
YqNYrYUiMfg,As if commanding officers in the British army of the First World War had taken care of a few hundred dead of their own soldiers. They have driven tens of thousands of people senselessly into German machine gun fire knowing what they were doing. The real 1917 was a little different. But it seems to be an entertaining movie nevertheless.
YqNYrYUiMfg,And here I was hoping to see something about the October Revolution.
YqNYrYUiMfg,We're never gonna get one from the German view are we? They always gotta be the bad guys
YqNYrYUiMfg,"It looks only ok, tbh.
Still gonna watch though because WWI."

YqNYrYUiMfg,Finally another war movie
YqNYrYUiMfg,Wow !! Kids may realize the First World War was not two paragraphs long now ...
YqNYrYUiMfg,That first minute was tense!! They could have passed that as a horror movie with a few added sound effects and some tweaks to the dialogue!! This definitely has my attention!

YqNYrYUiMfg,Gives LOTR vibes

YqNYrYUiMfg,They had to send a person to deliver the message in person because the commander had T-mobile as his cell provider.   Coverage on T-mobile is about the same today as it was in 1917.
YqNYrYUiMfg,This is the conservatives fighting off the nutty liberals

YqNYrYUiMfg,Looks like a defeatist movie. They could have chosen any heroic story of men going into battle whether they win or lose but having confidence in winning. Instead they chose one where the English are being told they can't win and they should retreat. These Hollywood liberals choose these particular stories for a reason.

Modern weapons, yes, of course; I just wonder if this isn‚Äôt a case of modern day thinking infringing upon historical accuracy just to add tension to a scene where they‚Äôre in a dark space underground."

YqNYrYUiMfg,"Speaking as a Rabbi, I'm somewhat conflicted by this movie. It looks fantastic, don't get me wrong-- but it's also 2019. Why the seeming lack of diversity in your casting, Universal? Why not have at least some roles in this film filled by open and proud members of the LGBTQIA+ community? I am disappointed."

YqNYrYUiMfg,"So instead of doing a legitimate movie that captures the drama and fear of the trenches, they make a bullshit story"

YqNYrYUiMfg,Oscar bait
YqNYrYUiMfg,"""We will lose 1600 men..."" This is kind of a drop in the bucket as far as WW 1 casualty figures are concerned. It's great that we're getting a film set during this conflict. But, I can't help but think a film about another major battle or story in this time period could be told. There's a ton of options to pick from, and they chose something that's kinda underwhelming."
YqNYrYUiMfg,Was that Benedict Cumberbatch? That has to be a great movie.
YqNYrYUiMfg,I can't wait to see this
YqNYrYUiMfg,Birdman Dunkirk?
YqNYrYUiMfg,Could nab the Best Cinematography Oscar because that looks stunning
YqNYrYUiMfg,"This looks pretty good for sure, but just very similar to most war movies and so it loses me a little because of that. Dunkirk spoiled me because it was the most different war movie ever made and it just fucking nailed it. Dunkirk succeeded so well because it chose not to actually go the personal route and instead chose to highlight all the shit the actually matters in war. The fear, the sound, the suspense, the fucking will to survive at all costs. Every other war movie inserts this personal story into the mix that we've all seen before because I guess it pulls at the heart strings of the movie goers which is fine and all. If it works don't fix it. But I always want new things, and I think that is why Dunkirk is so incredibly spectacular. You hardly remember the names of any characters because it doesn't matter. You never once see the enemy, because it doesn't matter. There is no plot because it doesn't matter in this situation. There is one goal, live and get the fuck across that water to go home. This is why Dunkirk is so special to me."
YqNYrYUiMfg,I am here for it!!!
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Instead of sending 2 soldiers to walk through battles to deliver a message let me display a few more options

YqNYrYUiMfg,00:49 this was definitely not how WW1 soldiers cleared corners. This is not realistic. Not even in the 80s did soldiers move in such a way.

YqNYrYUiMfg,"Another action movie in the old form and no true history? This is my first impression, I hope I'm wrong."
YqNYrYUiMfg,1600 men is a drop in the pail of casualties for WWI
YqNYrYUiMfg,Please make more soldier movies every year.... I love soldier movies! üòç
YqNYrYUiMfg,Amazing
YqNYrYUiMfg,"love it, because it will only have white people in it.. none of that gay feminist sjw garbage they taint every movie with today."
YqNYrYUiMfg,Finally a prequel to Saving Private Ryan
YqNYrYUiMfg,Looks like a cross between Saving Private Ryan and Gallipoli.
YqNYrYUiMfg,Lord Of The Rings 1917?
YqNYrYUiMfg,Plot seems nonsensical but I‚Äôm looking forward to it nonetheless
YqNYrYUiMfg,Dunkirk copy paste
YqNYrYUiMfg,They forgot to add the other two brothers.
YqNYrYUiMfg,GERMANY WAS RIGHT BOTH WARS
YqNYrYUiMfg,"I really want to watch this now. Looks so intense, almost dunkirk vibes but.. different."

YqNYrYUiMfg,I hope the movie is good because im definitely looking forward to this
YqNYrYUiMfg,frodo and sam in ww1?
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Another propaganda movie. The winners write history, that's why the British and French are shown as 'the good guys'. Germans and Ottomans need to unite again, Christianity and Islam in the fight against ≈π√òƒ¢ J∆èW≈îY."
YqNYrYUiMfg,Whoaaaa. Doctor strange is here!
YqNYrYUiMfg,"""let's trust the lives of 1600 men to two soldiers, we can't send any more than that for sake of the plot"""
YqNYrYUiMfg,Looks good
YqNYrYUiMfg,Why not just send a carrier pigeon?
YqNYrYUiMfg,I really hope its rated R so they can REALLY try and depict the horrors of war.. not this EXPLOSION and fly away with no scars B.S.
YqNYrYUiMfg,I hope it‚Äôs as gory as saving private Ryan
YqNYrYUiMfg,shitty low budget movie.
YqNYrYUiMfg,"And now the UK has become a third world country.... Wonder how many would have switched sides if they knew what would become of their ""victory""..."
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Not gonna lie, the large quantity of grass kinda bothers me. We should be seeing mud and water."
YqNYrYUiMfg,"this movie is racist, where's the genderless people of color with disability actor?"

YqNYrYUiMfg,Tommen Barathean is alive lol
YqNYrYUiMfg,Ww1 was an amazingly horrific war. We need more films on it. This looks great.
YqNYrYUiMfg,What a dumb title.
YqNYrYUiMfg,For some reason I feel like the movie is going to end with them giving the order and the officer in charge still attacks as he simply doesn't believe it is a real message from HQ. Sadly there were stories like that during ww1 or messages that was received too late.
YqNYrYUiMfg,"This better be fucking good, my grandad  signed up when he was 16  and was a runner between the trenches taking messages before there was radios. The story's of pure hell he used to tell us little children in the 60's I will never forget."
YqNYrYUiMfg,It looks.....tooo... clean

YqNYrYUiMfg,Horror movies for veterans ü§î
YqNYrYUiMfg,Looks amazing
YqNYrYUiMfg,This Bf1 Is really nice to see without hud
YqNYrYUiMfg,I like that new ww1 movie coming out. But what is this weird order he is telling them to do. Private soldiers running to some random part of trench warfare to stop assault with maybe no real cancel orders from a superior officer.
YqNYrYUiMfg,boys locker room:
YqNYrYUiMfg,Dunkirk part Two
YqNYrYUiMfg,I wish he had similar courage in GOT.

YqNYrYUiMfg,Sooooooo Frodo Baggins meets WW1
YqNYrYUiMfg,Damn i forgot this movie was coming out lol
YqNYrYUiMfg,"It looks like it has potential, but gong to fall short of it."
YqNYrYUiMfg,"You think this is bad, their last mission was to deliver the One Ring to Mount Doom."
YqNYrYUiMfg,its simple just send the pigeon xd
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Battlefield 1 made me ‚Äùa fan‚Äù of this episode of History. After that, the movie Lawrence of Arabia and the book A Farewell to Arms were so enjoyable and interesting"
YqNYrYUiMfg,"****Spoiler alert, his brother escapes from the prison, lost and confused he find a beuatiful  lady, she takes care of him, they fall in love and 9 months later have a baby and they name him Hitler*****"

YqNYrYUiMfg,lmao why did i think this was wonder woman
YqNYrYUiMfg,Benedict bumbaclart
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Two guys, on a delivery mission hiding from enemy forces going through swamps and rivers to save people. That's Lord of the Rings isn't it?"
YqNYrYUiMfg,Looks ok! I'd give it a chance! Not in the expensive theatre but on Netflix for sure!
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Honestly I'm just happy the two main characters are wearing Brodie helmets. I'm looking at you, Dunkirk."
YqNYrYUiMfg,BF1
YqNYrYUiMfg,One thing!!! The British didn't run into battle cause the officers thought it'd make people break ranks other than that I couldn't see a major thing pretty excited here
YqNYrYUiMfg,A WW1 themed movie? Don't mind if I do. I can't wait for this one!
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Hopefully there is a satisfactory explanation on why field telephones, radios, carrier pigeons, etc, would not work, or why delivering a message to a battalion in the front-line would be difficult even by foot."
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Should've just done the trailer as a 'one shot' too, to make it not look so generic. Can't WAIT to see it!"
YqNYrYUiMfg,dam they show all the movie.
YqNYrYUiMfg,"*_""Lions led by Donkeys""_** - WW1 films are a must watch for me, it was supposed to be the war to end all wars. Very much looking forward to **_1917_*"
YqNYrYUiMfg,"When the sun goes down, we will remember them üá¨üáßüá¨üáßüá¨üáßüá¨üáßüá¨üáßüá¨üáßüá¨üáß RIP"

YqNYrYUiMfg,"When i hear galahad voice i though it was kingsman then i check the titles again üòÇ
Damn man i need some sleep for sure..."
YqNYrYUiMfg,"It stars Sherlock (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Jim Moriarty Andrew Scott) both on the same side. The Allies should have won the war before it even started, say 1913."
YqNYrYUiMfg,What's that song called?
YqNYrYUiMfg,wow
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Always the same scheme... Not only English, French and Russian exist. It's a little boring."
YqNYrYUiMfg,hopefully they don't demonize the germans and portray the way the british and germans treated each other outside of combat: as humans who were merely fighting for different countries.
YqNYrYUiMfg,*The enemy is being reinforced with an AIRSHIP*
YqNYrYUiMfg,"I was on the edge of my seat holding my breath till the end of this trailer.. 
Now Wondering..
(movie might just asphyxiate me)"
YqNYrYUiMfg,I don't know why...but this already looks like a lit masterpiece
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Just when I thought Endgame would be the only highlight from Hollywood this year Joker and 1917 are quickly cementing themselves as favorites before they're even realased. Can't wait to see what's in store for both films!

And not to mention the Irishmen but I am getting ahead of myself."
YqNYrYUiMfg,The same plot as Gallippoli
YqNYrYUiMfg,0:01 hey its that guy who stars in that other thing from the 1910s!
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Damn, this Kingsman prequel looks really intense."
YqNYrYUiMfg,somone really likes Dunkirk
YqNYrYUiMfg,I thought this was a movie based of the SCP foundation tale 1914
YqNYrYUiMfg,Was that Sherlock Holmes AND Moriarty I saw...
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Wow this will suck, just like my apple stock"
YqNYrYUiMfg,People are still upset about this event. Too soon!

YqNYrYUiMfg,Finally the Blackadder movie!
YqNYrYUiMfg,"1:15 This just happened yesterday, with a B-17 from the 1930's. Killed seven people."
YqNYrYUiMfg,What is that song in the middle ?
YqNYrYUiMfg,oh no another war movie...
YqNYrYUiMfg,The transition to the movie title was cool.
YqNYrYUiMfg,Battlefield 4
YqNYrYUiMfg,I think this is one of the best movies.
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Looks great, but what a horrible selection of music in the second half."
YqNYrYUiMfg,"The one-shot idea is great. Besides that, I have some problems:
1. Again it's a movie from the british perspective. I miss the times when ""Paths to Glory"" and ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" where shot from the French or German perspective. They should emphasize on that more.
2. The overuse of the Western front as a WW1 setting starts to become exhausting. Maybe they should look more at less-filmed settings, like the Eastern Front, the Southern Front or the Mesopotamian front"
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Well, I didn't expect this to be one of the top films I must see. Touche...."
YqNYrYUiMfg,So this movie was done in one continuous shot?
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Oh shoot, is that Benedryl Pumpkinpatch!"

YqNYrYUiMfg,This will be one of my favorite war movies for sure
YqNYrYUiMfg,Doctor strange be using the time stone again
YqNYrYUiMfg,World War I? Who cares about that one? World War II is where it's at. We already have a hundred thousand movies about it. What's one more?
YqNYrYUiMfg,What where are all the women on the front lines EA lied to me said I was ignorant I didn‚Äôt know that women fought in World War I and World War II all over the front lines where is the cricket bats or the prosthetic hands
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Roger Deakins is definitely the man for WW1 cinematography. But I'm not fully on board with the story they have decided to go with though. When I first heard 1917, I would have thought Passchendaele. Still looks great. Can't wait to watch"
YqNYrYUiMfg,Heres my money.
YqNYrYUiMfg,The visuals look gorgeous hope the films good
YqNYrYUiMfg,Saving private Ryan but in ww1

YqNYrYUiMfg,If you think this trailer looks good watch behind the scenes of how they filmed it. This looks awesome.
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Why is it that after nearly 50 years of ww2 era films, we only have a handful of ww1 films. 

And why am I more interested in them?"
YqNYrYUiMfg,Sam Mendes and Roger Deakins? Im sold!
YqNYrYUiMfg,"DUMB, just send a pigeon... Saving Private Ryan ripoff"
YqNYrYUiMfg,Woah
YqNYrYUiMfg,Everything was great until that sassy music started. Better stick to more authentic score.
YqNYrYUiMfg,The alternate universe of no lootboxes.
YqNYrYUiMfg,This is ‚ÄúSaving Brother Ryan‚Äù
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Kind of figured a movie called ""1917"" would be about the Russian Revolution."
YqNYrYUiMfg,CHILLS
YqNYrYUiMfg,Is the brother named Ryan?
YqNYrYUiMfg,Okay... now make a movie about the Greek Ten Thousands please in the same way! :)
YqNYrYUiMfg,I hope will be better than Dunkirk. Hope is dangerous things
YqNYrYUiMfg,This looks fuck... incredible !
YqNYrYUiMfg,Cableclaw Hunterfetch was definitely the best choice for this movie.
YqNYrYUiMfg,GREAT WAR AND I CANNOT TAKE MORE
YqNYrYUiMfg,Omg üò± Veryy Goodd
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Hate the people who are comparing this to saving private Ryan , let it be its own film like hacksaw ridge and war horse etc"
YqNYrYUiMfg,No Hollywood movie will ever be able to reproduce the real HELL those poor people went through. All because some fat ass bastards want more power and wealth for themselves.
YqNYrYUiMfg,This is how you do a trailer
YqNYrYUiMfg,Arent you glad there are cellphones now.
YqNYrYUiMfg,"I hope it¬¥s rated R

YqNYrYUiMfg,But where is the lesbian bionic arm woman?

I was right to be hyped from the very beginning it was announced. Bring it on!"
YqNYrYUiMfg,Battlefield 1 anyone?
YqNYrYUiMfg,This film looks fantastic. I am speechless by the cinematography and shots of this film. Love the fact it‚Äôs Roger Deakins using his talent to get the angles of the shot compositions! Should be a great film!

YqNYrYUiMfg,This looks real good
YqNYrYUiMfg,The german police went there to arrest the british army
YqNYrYUiMfg,"Of the 60 million soldiers who fought in the First World War, over 9 million were killed ‚Äî 14% of the combat troops or 6,000 dead soldiers per day. The armies of the Central Powers mobilized 25 million soldiers and 3.5 million of them died. The Entente Powers deployed 40 million soldiers and lost more than 5 million.


Looks good but the plot of 1600 men are going to die is lame, that being said the brother part definitely fills the void."
YqNYrYUiMfg,Tommen isn't weak this time üòÇüòÇ
YqNYrYUiMfg,"When Mendes and Deakins said that this film is shot in one-continous shot, they're not lying. Very much looking forward for this."

YqNYrYUiMfg,This looks like a multiplayer map off COD ghost haha but nevertheless it'll be a good movie
YqNYrYUiMfg,Universal needs to chill with these trailers. Almost gave away the whole movie

YqNYrYUiMfg,Hype train here we come
YqNYrYUiMfg,Battlefield 1 : The Movie
YqNYrYUiMfg,"I hate that melodramatic ""movie trailer line"" that more and more movies have these days. The 'hope is a dangerous thing' no one would just come out with that in real life in that situation. Like i say its melodramatic. In my opinion at least.


also, imagine having a film called 1917 and not having it be about red october üôÑ thats only the main world shattering event that happened that year. when you think of big years for WWI you think of '14, '16 and '18 because of the big battles, no one talks about 1917"
YqNYrYUiMfg,So many one shots...so epic. Can‚Äôt wait
YqNYrYUiMfg,This looks really good!
YqNYrYUiMfg,Clockticking in the trailer?? It this movie also scored by Hans Zimmer?

YqNYrYUiMfg,Can u imagine the pain and hurt the death and destruction to see it and feel it. We owe so much to the fallen forgotten heroes and those who survived. They did so much for us and this looks like a good film to watch.

YqNYrYUiMfg,And the Oscar for best cinematography goes too.....Roger Deakins.
YqNYrYUiMfg,"With Dunkirk and now 1917, it seems old school war epics are making a much needed comeback! Less glamour and more realistic suspense."
YqNYrYUiMfg,"okay let's get the inclusiveness checklist for movies about the 2nd or 1st world war out:
-black germans X
-female soldiers X
-strong emphasis on men being bad for not letting either of the two serve and fight with them with no explanation or mentioning of factual evidence of the opposite X
-historical portrayal of events that is authentic to the time period, ignoring modern day standards and society, instead focusing on what it was like back then to tell a good story using the historical backdrop for effect, which is shot almost entirely live (pretty much no/very little CGI) ‚úî


tl;dr - I have high hopes for this one, you should too"

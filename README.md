Social Web 2020 - Group 13  - Vrije Universiteit

Predicting the success of a movie before its theatrical release is a challenging problem. Since the emerge of the social web, users share their opinion about (upcoming) movies on YouTube. Analyzing this user-generated data could potentially predict how successful a movie is going to be. Methodology.We applied sentiment analysis on 154467 comments from trailers on YouTube from 28 different movies. After that Pearsonâ€™s coefficient was computed to test the relation between sentiment and movie success. Results.We found a neutral sentiment in the comments of most movies, with a sentiment score between 0.005 and 0.01. No significant relation was found between sentiment and movie rating or between sentiment and revenue. Conclusion.We were not able to predict the success of a movie with the sentiment of YouTube comments. Limitations.It is difficult to account for sarcasm, humor or negation with sentiment analysis. Predicting the success of movies might be possible with more accurate of sentiment analysis algorithms.
